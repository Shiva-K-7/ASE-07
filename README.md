This project is to cluster the Simulink project to different domains of projects based on the metadata provided using Kmeans clustering.

In iteration 1, we have performed numerical clustering based on some useful numerical attributes of the data and grouped the projects into academic projects and industrial projects.

In iteration 2, we have performed text clustering based on description and other related attributes and gouped the projects into different domains like robotics projects, vehicle related projects and so on.
