24,3019,Airlib,Giampiero Campa,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3019-airlib,The Aircraft Library,"<p>Airlib is a library of aircraft models to be used with Simulink 3.1 (MATLAB 5.3) or later (tested until 2018a).It is based on two basic blocks that implement a continuous-time and a discrete-time nonlinear general aircraft model. The initial version, dated Feb 2003, contains 13 different nonlinear aircraft models including, among others, a Boeing 747, an F4 Phantom, an F104 Starfighter, an X15, an IAI Pioneer (unmanned), a Convair 880 and four different Cessna models. Each model is a link to one of the two library blocks, but of course with different parameters on the mask. Indeed, the type of aircraft is entirely specified by the inertial and aerodynamic parameters typed on the mask, which also includes a very detailed help that describes the meaning of inputs, states, outputs and mask parameters.An example showing a Boeing 747 in a (closed loop) straight and level flight is also given. In May 2003 a very effective MATLAB function (air3m.m) was added to allow the user to easily trim any given aircraft for any combination of desired speed, altitude, and flight path angle.In March 04, a function that computes the aerodynamic derivatives from the linear model matrices was added, together with a Simulink model that compares two different ways of handling the wind in the equations of motions.In July 2006 a full guidance and control system based on the feedback linearization of the aircraft kinematic and dynamics was added. The scheme includes a waypoint generation system, and can be easily adapted to any aircraft with known aerodynamics coefficients.Please have a look to the readme.txt file for more detailed info.Giampiero Campa, March 2004</p>","aerospace,boeing 747,aerodef,aerodynamics,aeronautics,aerospace,aircraft,boeing 747,cessna,fdc,flight,x1,aerodef",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1692307-giampiero-campa,2019-01-02 17:31:58.000000,2019-01-02 17:31:58.000000,14,9,4.0,16,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/e54484fc-4a80-11e4-9553-005056977bd0/8ae9c0fb-4b45-47c3-a460-00d0070d83a4/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2018, The MathWorks, Inc.

Broom Balancing (Inverted Pendulum on a cart) is a well known example of nonlinear, unstable control problem. This problem becomes further complicated when a flexible broom, in place of a rigid broom, is employed. Degree of complexity and difficulty in its control increases with its flexibility. This problem has been a research interest of control engineers. In this submission, however, we have analyzed Inverted Pendulum only with rigid broom.The aim of this study is to stabilize the Inverted Pendulum such that the position of the carriage on the track is controlled quickly and accurately so that the pendulum is always erected in its inverted position during such movements.The inverted pendulum (IP) is among the most difficult systems to control in the field of control engineering. Due to its importance in the field of control engineering, it has been a task of choice to be assigned to Control Engineering students to analyze its model and propose a linear compensator according to the PID control law.The work included in this submission has been carried out in the Instrumentation and Control Lab at the Institute of Industrial Electronics Engineering, Karachi, Pakistan.The author would like to thank Dr. Ken Dutton [School of Engineering, Sheffield Hallam University, UK; Author: ""Art of Control Engineering""] for his review of this submission.</p>","inverted pendulum,nonlinear unstable system,pid design,simulation,inverted pendulum,simulation,pid design,simulation,inverted pendulum,inverted pendulum,inverted pendulum,inverted pendulum,inverted pendulum,nonlinear unstable system,inverted pendulum,inverted pendulum,nonlinear unstable system,inverted pendulum",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/37478-khalil-sultan,2007-02-09 17:39:21.000000,2007-02-09 17:39:21.000000,35,38,4.0,41,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/3790/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2003, Khalil Sultan

This block allows plotting the motion of SEVERAL points in the XYZ space.In other words each point draws a line as it moves, so you end up having several lines in the plot instead of just one. Setting the camera position parameter to [0 0 1] reduces the plot to a classic 2D one.This block is very useful when you have to compare the motion of a point versus a reference trajectory.

(It's actually just a modified version of dspstfft_win32.mdl, a demo that ships with the Signal Processing Blockset.)You could just as easily use the same approach to interface your models to other support plug-in data acquisition hardware, not to mention a variety of other data sources.   * You could interface Simulink to scientific instruments like an oscilloscope, network analyzer, power meter, or waveform generator using the Instrument Control Toolbox.   * Your models could process live video and image data from cameras and frame grabbers supported by the Image Acquisition Toolbox.   * You could hook your model up to Oracle or another ODBC or JDBC compliant database using the Database Toolbox.   * Your Simulink models can take advantage of MATLAB's Generic DLL calling capability.  Just about anything you can do in MATLAB, you can use the MATLAB Function block to do from Simulink.  Hopefully this example helps get you started.  For more advanced capabilities, refer to the Simulink documentation regarding S-functions, particularly M-file S-functions.

This can be either a static misalignment or a time varying misalignment, like when an antenna is mounted on a tower that sways in the wind.Communications signals can also be totally blocked by obstructions passing in front of an antenna.  An example would be an antenna mounted in a buoy out at sea that occasionally has a wave wash over it.    Both these conditions cause a loss in overall communications performance.  The models in this submission show how to simulate these effects of antenna  misalignment and obstruction in a Simulink communications system simulation.  1- XModel6.  This model is a comms simulation with perfect antenna pointing.2- XModel6Gauss.  This model shows how to simulate a static misalignment between a transmit and receive antenna.  The antenna pattern used in this example is a Gaussian approximation.3- XModel6Sinc.  This model shows how to simulate a dynamic pointing loss.  In this case the misalignment is simulated with a sinusoidal function.  The antenna pattern used in this example is for a square feed horn, which has a sinc rolloff characteristic.4- XModel6SincBlocked.

71,11092,Bond graph add-on block library BG V.2.1,Gert-Helge Geitner,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11092-bond-graph-add-on-block-library-bg-v-2-1,Customizable add-on library with a small number of blocks for graphical programming of Bond Graph models using standard Simulink and editor.,"<p>Why Bondgraphs?The energy domain independently Bond Graph is an excellent power flow diagram for process models [see DOI:10.1109/epe.2005.219609]. Detailed introductions to the Bond Graph method may be found here for instance: <a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/journal_club/papers/Samantaray__2001__www.bondgraphs.com_about.pdfRealization"">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/journal_club/papers/Samantaray__2001__www.bondgraphs.com_about.pdfRealization</a> using Simulink:Replace each half arrow connection by one visible connection drawn by the standard editor, presenting optionally a flow or an effort connection. The implementation of the conjugated back connection for the complementary power variable effort or flow will be done automatically via software background. In addition the blocks are defined switchable, e.g. regarding causality or block function in order to reduce the number of library blocks. Library version 2.1 consists of 9 blocks only which realize the whole necessary functionality. These blocks may be used by means of drag &amp; drop technique and have to be configured menu-driven as usual for Simulink. See homepagehttps://etiema.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_8_1e.htmof this Bond Graph library for more info including 10 pdf files for documentation, 4 lists of examples or on-line list with icon, function/mask and parameter.Features:Typical examples for combined functionalities are the energy storage block (choice of I or C type) or the node block (choice of 0 or 1 type). Environment connections to standard Simulink blocks ensure S/D and AB blocks, i.e. controllers may only drive a Bond Graph by means of source blocks and a measurement of Bond Graph power variables may only be done by use of AB blocks. All blocks are able to operate with scalar or vectorial bond connections optionally. The user may set constant parameters directly via block mask or work with variable parameters by defining an additional parameter input if allowable for the considered element like as for TF or GY. Alternatively the definition of a second file filename_P.m causes the allocation of determined or calculated numerical values to symbolic defined parameters for the Bond Graph blocks. The block masks offer different additional adjustments as for instance number of inputs and outputs as well as operation mode for node blocks or initial values as well as additional momentum, displacement or power output for energy storage blocks. Each block provides a protection of its functionality, i.e. in this case a first mask access step only allows the change of the parameter value. Operation mode modifications must be unlocked in a second step afterwards. Nodes and measurements:Since one power variable of the power variable pairs at any node block has been defined to be constant there are two different icons per node type necessary. The appearance forms of the icon and the underlying equations are documented. Any effort or flow variables of a Bond Graph may be measured by means of an so-called AB block which realizes the activated bond functionality whereas momentum, displacement or power are immediately disposal at each storage element.Summary:Simulink add-on library BG V.2.1 offers a tool for the graphical programming of power flow diagrams in terms of Bond Graphs. Nine blocks ensure all essential modes via menu input. That way e.g. causality changes, nonlinearities, initial values, vectorial operation, power outputs or protection of settings are ensured. Examples describe different usage as for process modelling, control loops (example ElaWe_GM_ZuReg) or energy efficiency based on integration (example GM_EE). The tool, all examples and a short documentation are included.

This tool carries the blocks with built-in Global Positioning algorithm (related to dead-reckoning), which are useful in finding out the current position and heading of the vehicle robot. This blockset will allow the scientists and engineers to build and simulate their models of vehicle robot using differential drive steering method according to their own design and specifications, and will enable to visualize the results in the form of model-driven animation.The blockset has seven different blocks: The PMDC Motor block, Gearbox block, Motor Driver block, Mechanical Dimensions block, Positioning block, Dual PID block and the Animation block. These blocks constitute a complete set of components by using which a complete model of a differentially driven vehicle robot can be built. The resulting model can be tested in the form of model-driven animation and the parameters of the model can be varied from the GUI provided in the animation window on the fly.The PMDC Motor block is a complete model of a Permanent magnet DC motor. A user can put its own parameter values of DC motor which he wants to use in the actual model of robot. This model also simulates the applied load on the motor shaft.Gearbox block is simulated gear-train whose gear-ratio can be set according to user specifications.Motor Driver block behaves like the practical motor driver circuits, using whose logical inputs the direction of PMDC motor can be reversed, and break can be applied.By including the Mechanical Dimensions block in the model user can implement the model of a differentially driven vehicle robot whose dynamic behavior will largely depend on the mechanical dimensions like drive wheel radii, robot platform length and width, and location of drive wheels in robot platform.Positioning block calculates the current position of the vehicle robot turning center in Global Coordinate System.Dual PID Control block provides a pair of PID controllers for each motor of the differential drive system for speed control.Finally, the Animation Block generates animation of the designed differentially driven vehicle robot according to model specifications. The animation window also provides the GUI in the form of different sliders using which the angular velocities of the wheels can be varied, and also the direction of the motors can be reversed during simulation.</p>","automotive,control design,differentials,global positioning,gui,simulation,simulink,vehicle robot,electric_motor_control,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/297595-jahanzeb-rajput,2013-01-21 16:14:57.000000,2013-01-21 16:14:57.000000,5,5,2.0,11,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/13332/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2004, Jahanzeb Rajput

This S-function creates a block that reads data from a file incrementally at each time step of the Simulink simulation.The S-function was written in C and uses the standard file I/O functions from the stdio.h library (fopen, fscanf, fclose).  It is intended merely as an example.  The trickiest part of writing S-functions can sometimes be maintaining  persistent data in subsequent calls to the S-function.  This issue presents itself in this example.  In order to read from the file throughout the simulation without closing and reopening the file each time step, the FILE pointer is stored in the PWork vector.  This gives the S-function access to the FILE pointer at each step in the simulation.In this S-function, the mdlStart function opens the file at the start of the simulation and the mdlTerminate function closes the file at the end.  The mdlOutputs function is used to read data from the file at every time step.To run the example:1) Entermex -setupat the MATLAB Command Prompt and select a compiler2) Copy the attached files to the current MATLAB directory3) Entermex cfileiosfun.cto compile the S-function4) Open the attached model and simulate.</p>","c,cmex,data export,data import,fscanf,input,mex,output,sfunction,stdioh,c,cmex,fscanf,input,mex,output,sfunction,stdioh,cmex,data import,c,stdioh",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/495579-jarrod-rivituso,2016-09-01 15:06:00.000000,2016-09-01 15:06:00.000000,3,4,3.0,7,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/13438/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2007, The MathWorks, Inc.

99,15268,DSP algorithms using Embedded MATLAB Block,Kiran Kintali,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/15268-dsp-algorithms-using-embedded-matlab-block,using Embedded MATLAB block effectively in Simulink,"<p>Embedded MATLAB block provides a way of bringing restricted subset of MATLAB into Simulink. There are couple of possibilities when moving untimed MATLAB algorithms into Simulink. This demo illustrates two such alternatives in porting a sample viterbi algorithm (written in M) into Simulink using embedded MATLAB. The subsystem 'eML_viterbi_ex1' implements the whole algorithm in a single monolithic embedded MATLAB block, where as 'eML_viterbi_ex2' has a similar implementation but broken down into multiple embedded MATLAB  blocks. The former approach can be used to quickly port existing M code into Simulink and verify that it works the same using the debugging capabilities provided by embedded MATLAB block coupled with signal logging and data visualization capabilities provided by Simulink.The latter approach has the visual appeal and shows the break down of complex piece of logic in mutilple blocks and graphically displays the hierarchy and data flow. In this case the algorithm is broken down into Brach Metric, Path Metric and Trace back units. The Path Metric is further broken down to Add Compare Seelect and Renormalization units. One of the further advantages of breaking down the algorithm into multiple blocks is that when going for hardware implementation of this algorithm, tradeoffs between area and speed can be explored by placing pipeline registers (integer delay blocks) between blocks and to identify critical path etc.,</p>","dsp,embedded matlab,fpga,simulink,viterbi,fpga,fpga,fpga,dsp,dsp,dsp",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/893333-kiran-kintali,2016-09-01 15:06:31.000000,2016-09-01 15:06:31.000000,1,2,3.0,3,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/15268/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, The MathWorks, Inc.

102,15368,Two Methods for Breaking Data Dependency Loops in System Level Models,Michael Burke,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/15368-two-methods-for-breaking-data-dependency-loops-in-system-level-models,Methods for removing data dependencies with a minimum number of blocks,"<p>Creation of a system by integrating multiple validated subcomponents is a task common to Simulink® and C.  In both environments integration issues arise as the number of components increases.  Problems include miss-matched data types, scaling and ensuring the correct signals are available, to name a few.  These are all challenges that systems integrators are used to solving.  However; the integration process in Simulink exposes data dependency issues that are normally hidden in the C development environment.Data dependency is the requirement that for any calculation, all the values on the right hand side (RHS) of equation are known prior to starting the calculation.  The value on the left hand (LHS) side is dependent on the values of the right hand side.  In the contexts of subsystems, the concept of calculation order is equivalent to execution order of the subsystems.LHSn = f (RHSn)The C language does not prevent users from writing equations where the LHS is assigned before the RHS.  This means that an old or non-initialized data can be used which can result in unexpected or incorrect results.LHSn = f (RHSn-1)LHSn = f (??)Unlike C, Simulink contains built in analysis tools that prevent this from happening.  Users of Simulink are familiar with these diagnostic, which are most commonly referred to as algebraic loops.  Loops are broken by explicitly setting the order of calculation.    This paper focuses on how to easily and systematically break these loops.Two methods are covered in this paper, using function-call subsystems and unit delay blocks.  Both of these methods can be used to define the execution order of the system.</p>","algebric loops,article,articles,paper,scheduling,whitepaper,whitepapers",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1044318-michael-burke,2016-09-01 15:06:35.000000,2016-09-01 15:06:35.000000,0,1,5.0,2,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/15368/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, The MathWorks, Inc.

In most cases they are characterized by a repetitive motion or sequence of motions between fixed positions. The actuator, or motor, is limited in speed and acceleration such that any decent motion control system should also generate an acceptable trajectory from one point to the other. This is done by generating ‘profiles’ for speed and acceleration. In practice, motion systems are not rigidly connected to the load they are manipulating, resulting in dynamical behaviour. Motion control systems deal with this by applying appropriate feedback control, and also by generating a ‘smooth’ trajectory. Feedforward control, based on the known trajectory also contributes greatly to achieving high performance positioning.The zip file contains MATLAB functions for calculating smooth trajectories. It also contains the Simulink library ‘motion’ with several examples, including an implementation suitable for real-time application (rapid prototyping). Extensive documentation, based on a course in motion control lectured at Eindhoven University of Technology in The Netherlands, explains the use of second order up to fourth order trajectories for point-to-point motion, how to calculate them, and how to use them for effective feedforward control. Some exercises are also included.The functions and library are developed in Release 12; they also work in all later releases.</p>","control design,demo,feedforward profile,motion control trajectory,motion control trajectory setpoint planning feedforward profile,setpoint planning,electric_motor_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/688125-paul-lambrechts,2016-09-01 15:07:15.000000,2016-09-01 15:07:15.000000,6,9,5.0,30,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/16352/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, The MathWorks, Inc.

It illustrates the use of parameters in Embedded MATLAB. The algorithm has three sections; Setup, Output and Update. At every sample time hit the block keeps accumulating the the value of the input at time instant 't' in a state register and emits value accumulated value until time instant 't-1'. The output value is clipped if falls above an upper limit or falls below a lower limit. A flag is raised when the value is clipped. The upper and lower limits and the gain of the integrator can be changed via Embedded MATLAB block parameters.Like any other block in Simulink the Embedded MATLAB block also supports mask parameters. Simulink parameters can be tunable or non-tunable. Tunable parameter values can be changed during the simulation run in MATLAB workspace and can be used to affect the current Simulink simulation run in progress. Non-tunable parameters are also defined in MATLAB workspace but are fixed for a single simulation run.In the attached model the variables 'gain_val', 'upper_limit', 'lower_limit' used in the Embedded MATLAB script are non-tunable parameters. They are declared as any other inputs in the function declaration associated with the block. However they do not appear as block inputs. The values and types of these variables can be defined and changed in the MATLAB between simulation runs.</p>","discrete,embedded matlab,fpga,hdl,integrator,parameters,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/893333-kiran-kintali,2016-09-01 15:07:16.000000,2016-09-01 15:07:16.000000,0,0,0.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/16363/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, The MathWorks, Inc.

They are the models used in the Simscape Hands-on Workshop events offered by the MathWorks.   The examples here are models in Simscape, Simscape Multibody, Simscape Driveline, Simscape Electrical, and Simscape Fluids that you can build starting with an empty Simulink model. One example focuses on the Simscape language. There are also examples showing you how to use these tools with Simulink Design Optimization, and Stateflow.

132,18075,Vectorizable Embedded MATLAB Function,Bill Potter,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18075-vectorizable-embedded-matlab-function,This set of Simulink models demonstrates how to create a reusable Embedded MATLAB function for scala,"<p>The three Simulink models provided demonstrate how to develop a reusable Embedded MATLAB function that can be used on scalars and vectors.  The Embedded MATLAB function, a simple quadratic equation, is implemented in the model my_eml_func.mdl.  This model is referenced as a Model Reference in the library my_lib.mdl.  The library contains a configurable subsystem that can be set to either a scalar or vector choice.  The scalar choice contains just the reference model for the Embedded MATLAB function and the vector choice contains the same reference model plus a for iterator, vector selector blocks and a vector assignment block.  The latter subsystem allows the Embedded MATLAB function to operate in a for loop that addapts to the size of the input signals.  A third model, eml_mr_inherited_dim.mdl, includes three instances of the library block to demostrate how the single Embedded MATLAB function can be used for a scalar input, a vector input of width 3 and a vector input of width 5. This example does have two limitations.  This first limitation is that all inputs to the function must have the same vector width. The second limitation is that the Embedded MATLAB function cannot contain any persistent variables.This technique allows a reusable Embedded MATLAB function to be built and tested once, then the function can be reused many times in other models on any size input vector.For more information about the Embedded MATLAB subset, please visit the MathWorks web-site:<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/products/featured/embeddedmatlab/"">http://www.mathworks.com/products/featured/embeddedmatlab/</a></p>","embedded matlab,modelbased design,scalars,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/41788-bill-potter,2016-09-01 15:08:21.000000,2016-09-01 15:08:21.000000,0,0,0.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/18075/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2008, The MathWorks, Inc.

A m-script is provided to show how to use this model from the command window. Two examples taken from the File Exchange are included in the m-file to explain how the Kalman filter works.The package provides a way for beginners to learn the Kalman filter by just editting the model parameters without the need to know the details of calculation. By looking into masked subsystems, you will also be albe to learn how it can be implemented in Simulink. The model is developed in R14SP1 (MATLAB 7.0.1, Simulink 6.1). If you require it to work with previous version, please let me know.The new version removes a bug so that it can correctly work with non-zero D.</p>","filter analysis,filter design,gaussian process,kalman filter,simulink,state observer,state space control,kalman filter,kalman filter,kalman filter,filter design,kalman filter,kalman filter",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/69713-yi-cao,2011-02-22 15:05:50.000000,2011-02-22 15:05:50.000000,22,15,4.0,12,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/18465/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, Yi Cao

It shows how to compute mod3 of a 32 bit number as a tree of mod3 operations on a 4bit numbers which can be implemented as an inexpensive multiplexer.This algorithm breaks the binary number (m) into equal number of chunks and computes modulo(n) on the smaller chunks, concatenates the resultant values and repeats; This algorithm uses bitslice and bitconcat functions to extract smaller chunks (nibbles in this case) and a simple switch to calculate the mod3 of a 4bit slice;</p>","embedded matlab,fpga,hdl,modulo",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/893333-kiran-kintali,2016-09-01 15:08:47.000000,2016-09-01 15:08:47.000000,0,0,0.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/18727/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, The MathWorks, Inc.

The work has been published in International Journal of Automation and Computing, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 13�19, 2005. A preprint version of the paper is enclosed in the zip file.Gradient control is an approach to achieve optimal operation. The basic idea is that if the gradient of the cost function can be controlled at zero, then the overall system will operate at optimal condition. Anothernovalty of the work is to propose a cascade structure to deal with conditionally active constraints in optimizing control. To work with constraints, anti-windup PID controllers are used in the model.The evaporator of Newell and Lee is a popular example used in process control.

In case of a plant with a known dynamics, the coefficients C and time instant T of the shaper are computed in literature by a pole-zeros analysis.Genetic Algorithm is used here to train the shaper parameters accounting for plant uncertainties and even when no a priori knowledge is given about the dynamic. GA approach turn out to be extremely effective and is capable of improving the performances also in conditions when standard techniques are usually adopted.The Shaper is designed as a state machine in order to be easily coded within embedded systems, e.g. through Real Time Embedded Coder.The function implementing the GA optimization is  in the M-file shaperScan: it tunes the shaper parameters for the plant given in the model Plant.mdl (a 3-modes plant is given as an example).Ugo</p>","input shaping genetic algorithm,system identification,system identification",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1007719-ugo-pattacini,2008-05-28 08:59:31.000000,2008-05-28 08:59:31.000000,1,0,0.0,11,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/20069/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, Ugo Pattacini

Simulating that kind of coupled non-linear system seems to be tricky in Simulink®.At first I thought this challenge was going to be easy, I assembled a SimMechanics model, clicked play… but the pendulums are not synchronizing, as mentioned by Parasar in his post.Then I thought, let’s try with Simulink®. I implemented the equations provided and then face two choices:- By default, the coupling of the equations results in an algebraic loop. I try to let the algebraic loop solver resolving the algebraic loop, and the results are similar to the ones from SiMemchanics™. It looks like the Simulink® algebraic loop solver is doing a job similar to the SimMechanics™ solver. I cannot explain the exact reason, my guess is that the algebraic loop solver removes the non-linearity that makes the pendulums synchronize in real life. - My standard way to remove algebraic loops is to introduce a delay in the feedback path. In that case, the pendulums synchronize but the model becomes instable. The maximum sample time of the Simulink® solver must be adjusted to an appropriate value to obtain an acceptable tradeoff between synchronization and stability.I implemented the model using a vector approach. It allows easily changing the number of pendulums and modifying the algorithm.  From what I understand, the pendulum equations are non-linear and it should not be required to add any nonlinear limits, like bump stops in a metronome.I hope Seth will provide explanations on why no one has been able to obtain the synchronization using SimMechanics™.Guy</p>","mechanical modeling,metronome,synchronizing,systems",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1248313-guy-rouleau,2016-09-01 15:10:21.000000,2016-09-01 15:10:21.000000,0,0,0.0,3,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/21748/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, The MathWorks, Inc.

192,23965,anti-windup PID controller - SIMULINK block,Paul Acquatella,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23965-anti-windup-pid-controller-simulink-block,This SIMULINK block contains a PID controller with anti-windup,"<p>Although many aspects of a control system can be understood based on linear theory, some nonlinear effects must be accounted for in practically all controllers. Windup is such a phenomena, which is caused by the interaction of integral action and saturations. All actuators have limitations: a motor has limited speed, a valve cannot be more than fully opened or fully closed, etc. For a control system with a wide range of operating conditions, it may happen that the control variable reaches the actuator limits. When this happens the feedback loop is broken and the system runs as an open loop because the actuator will remain at its limit independently of the process output. If a controller with integrating action is used, the error will continue to be integrated. This means that the integral term may become very large or, colloquially, it “winds up”. It is then required that the error has opposite sign for a long period before things return to normal. The consequence is that any controller with integral action may give large transients when the actuator saturates.Ref: <a href=""http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/courses/cds101/fa02/caltech/astrom-ch6.pdf"">http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/courses/cds101/fa02/caltech/astrom-ch6.pdf</a></p>","anti windup,antiwindup,control,control design,dynamics,feedback,nonlinear,pid,saturation,simulink,windup,electric_motor_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/942400-paul-acquatella,2009-04-29 12:29:58.000000,2009-04-29 12:29:58.000000,5,1,1.0,4,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/23965/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2008, Paul Acquatella

195,24294,Simulink Signal Viewing using Event Listeners and a MATLAB UI.,Phil Goddard,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24294-simulink-signal-viewing-using-event-listeners-and-a-matlab-ui,This demo shows how to use block listeners to view model signals in a MATLAB user interface.,"<p>This application demonstrates how listeners can be attached to the blocks in a Simulink model, and how those listeners can be used to display block inputs and outputs on a MATLAB user interface.  (The main function for achieving this is called add_exec_event_listener.)The model can be executed either as a standard simulation or after being built into a generic real-time target (for those users with an RTW license).  In the later case, RTW's External Mode and TCP/IP is used to transfer data from the running executable to the model and thence to the UI.The use of listeners to view signals rather than the traditional approach of writing a custom S-Function block has at least 2 advantages: firstly the model is not ""corrupted"" by having to add any special viewing block (this is particularly advantageous if the model is also to be used with RTW); and secondly the same UI could be used to view signals from different models.Specifically this application works with a simple model called 'simpleModel.mdl', that contains the three blocks               Sine Wave --&gt; Gain --&gt; ScopeThe UI allows the model to be started and stopped, and allows the value of the gain to be tuned.  The value of the signal being fed into the Scope block is displayed on an axis on the UI.  The model does not have to be open to use the UI (and it's recommended for it to be closed).The UI allows the model to be run in either simulation mode (requiring a Simulink license) or as a generic real-time (GRT) executable (since the model must be ""built"" this requires an RTW license).It is intended as a demonstration program to show various aspects of using MATLAB, Simulink and RTW: - how to create a MATLAB UI using command line functionality - how to start/stop a Simulink model using command line functionality - how to add a listener to a Simulink block so that signals can be viewed from a MATLAB UI. - how to build a GRT executable using command line functionality - how to interface with code running in ""real-time"" (For the purposes of this UI the grt code is running on the host machine, so it is not running in hard real-time, however it is using External Mode to communicate with the code and hence shows how communication would be performed if the code was truly running on an RTOS.</p>","add_exec_event_listener,event listeners,grt,rtw,simulink,ui,user interface,pick of the week,potw",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/26433-phil-goddard,2009-11-02 13:45:02.000000,2009-11-02 13:45:02.000000,26,17,4.0,46,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/24294/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, Phil Goddard

206,24745,Dealing with array of buses in Simulink®,Vijay Swaminathan,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24745-dealing-with-array-of-buses-in-simulink,This demo shows a self modifying masked subsystem to split out the correct subbus from the superbus.,"<p>Here is the situation. Suppose you have a model that can analyze the properties of a meteor to track its trajectory. You want to use it in a larger model  which tracks many such meteors at the same time. You now need a block that can accept a superbus called Mainbus (that contains a lot of subbuses called meteorbus) and split out the relevant subbus (metoerbus). This block should be able to handles any changes in MainBus and meteorbus automatically on model update (no manual intervention).Solution:  Look at the example “ArrayofBus_example.mdl”.  I created a masked subsystem “Meteor Selector” which automatically looks at the Bus Objects (MainBus and meteorbus), figures out how many meteors are in the “MainBus” and the structure of the “misbus” and pulls out the correct meteor.  I simply used a Bus Selector which splits out ALL the meteors and then use a Multiport Switch to pass through the correct meteor(based on input frm the mask) to the outport.  The tricky part is to get this to work if the number of meteors in MainBus changes. I got this to happen by writing a script that figures out what needs to be done (at the time of model update) and put that in Mask Initialization callback. Essentially you have to set the correct number of ports for the Bus Selector and the Multiport Switch, delete the existing signal lines and add the required lines.  Instructions:Open the model “ArrayofBus_example.mdl” and follow the instructions in the annotation.</p>","self_rating,array of buses,building models from the command line,self modifying masks,self_rating",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1217152-vijay-swaminathan,2016-09-01 15:12:28.000000,2016-09-01 15:12:28.000000,2,2,4.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/24745/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, The MathWorks, Inc.

(Being written)It aims at demonstrating how you may use Matlab/Simulink together with Rapid STM32 blockset and ARM Cortex-M3 processors (STM32) to develop digital signal processing systems; using a tilt sensor as a case study. It covers the development process from design, simulation, hardware-in-the-loop testing, and creating a stand-alone embedded system. The content is supposed to be as simple/introductory as possible.In this first part:1. The motivation for using Simulink for embedded system development is explained. 2. A simplified model of tilt sensor system is developed. 3. Kalman filtering and Unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) theory is summarized. 4. Graphical instructions are then provided to guide you through the whole process of implementing a Simulink model to design, simulate, and evaluate the performance of an UKF for a tilt sensor system.Note: Source code is also provided to perform Monte Carlo simulation based on Simulink model to evaluate UKF performance using covariance analysis.In the second part, graphical instructions will be provided to guide you through the process of transferring your design from Simulink model to real-world stand-alone tilt sensor system based on Rapid STM32 - R1 Stamp board.Visit <a href=""http://www.rapidstm32.com"">www.rapidstm32.com</a> for more information.</p>","aerospace,arm,code generation,cortex m3,embedded system,estimation,kalman filter,microcontroller,nonlinear,realtime workshop embedded coder,signal processing,simulink,tilt sensor,estimation",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1900691-krisada-sangpetchsong,2009-08-05 05:18:29.000000,2009-08-05 05:18:29.000000,3,4,5.0,9,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/24917/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, Krisada Sangpetchsong

This model demonstrates how to:- Specify the motion (position, velocity and acceleration) of a joint and measure the force necessary to generate this motion. - Measure the force generated by Joint spring and damper blocks.- Generate a motion signal using Integrator blocks. I recommend defining the acceleration signal and integrating it twice. Specify the position and deriving it twice might lead to problems as the derivative block is more likely to produce infinite derivate at initialization.- How to define bodies in adjoining coordinates. Open one of the Body blocks, you will notice that CS1 position is [0 0 0] in the adjoining coordinates system. Other coordinates are relative to CS1. This allows copying this block and connecting it to another joint without any modification. Defining bodies using adjoining coordinates helps creating reusable systems.- The effect of SimMechanics™ visualization on simulation speed. Try to turn on and off the SimMechanics visualization from the simulation configuration parameters panel. You will see a huge impact on the simulation speed. You can control the refresh rate of the SimMechanics visualization by clicking “Control simulation speed” from the simulation menu of the SimMechanics visualization window. </p>","dynamics,inverse dynamics,simmechanics,simulink,dynamics,dynamics,inverse dynamics,simmechanics,simmechanics",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1248313-guy-rouleau,2016-09-01 15:12:31.000000,2016-09-01 15:12:31.000000,0,5,3.0,4,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/24961/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2009, The MathWorks, Inc.

Matlab is one of the leading softwares in model based and algorithmic designing. SpecC (close to ANSI C) is a high level language which can be implemented on hardware usingSystem on Chip Environment(SCE). Having the features of both procedural languages like C,C++ and Hardware Description languages like VHDL and Verilog and even more, SpecC can beconsidered as superior System Level Design Language which can be realized on hardware. Theease of translating Matlab/Simulink models to SpecC can show how algorithmic and modelbased designs can be realized on hardware.Simulink® Cruise control model and Matlab water-marker models were chosen astargets for being implemented in SpecC. In automobiles cruise control enables driver to avoidacceleration and slowing down of the car irregularly and maintain a steady speed. The systemtakes the speed of the vehicle and reference speed as inputs and computes the output velocity.The SpecC implementation of this Simulink model involves translation of Simulink blocks toSpecC behaviors, feedback to while loops and communication between blocks to shared variablecommunication in SpecC. The Matlab model will show how different functions can be translatedto SpecC which involves reading and writing text and audio files. The execution of thesebehaviors might vary from sequential to parallel and finite state machines. Thus this project dealswith the execution semantics in both Matlab/Simulink and in SpecC and investigates thetranslation of Matlab/Simulink models to SpecC.</p>","self_rating,automotive,control design,modelbased design,simulation,spec c,specification models,translator",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2031666-krishna-yalamanchili,2010-01-21 12:03:38.000000,2010-01-21 12:03:38.000000,0,0,0.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/26440/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2010, Krishna yalamanchili

Use the file ""twoDiode.mdl"" to calculate them.What you have now is the I-V characteristic of the solar panel which is depended from solar irradiation and ambient temperature. The I-V characteristic of your solar panel is implemented in the file ""solarpanel.mdl"". So you double click the model to define the constants and then you see three inputs. 1)global irradiation 2)temperature 3)Voltage. And you get the current.For example you keep global irradiation and temperature steady and change the voltage from 0 to the open circuit voltage and you get the nice I-V curve that you would see in your datasheet or manual of your solar panel product.If you want to connect this box with some resistance or a more complex circuit you would get the electrical behaviour of your solar panel.But in case you are only interested in power I have also uploaded the file ""solarpanel_power.mdl"" which has only two inputs: 1) global irradiation and 2) temperature. The solar panel is supposed to be working at Maximum Power Point instantaneously all of the time.Ok now let's see why we got in all this trouble.Let's say that your panel has a peak performance of 15%. But noone really cares about STC conditions. In case your country is a bit north maybe there not any time in the year where solar irradiation is 1000W/m^2 so your solar panel would never reach this performance. What you really care is the mean performance for your own territory.This is easy. You simple go to this website: <a href=""http://www.soda-is.com/You"">http://www.soda-is.com/You</a> get fill a form of where you live and in what inclination you have installed your panels and you get the irradiation that the surface of your panels receive in a hourly basis for all the year. Yes you get 8760 values. And another 8760 values for the temperature.There you have to play a little bit with Matlab to extract the values from the excel. Use the xlsread(). Don;t worry you only do this once unless you move to a different area or change the inclination of your panels.Time to get the results.Use the irradiation and temperature values as inputs and let the Simulink simulate your solar panel for a whole year. As output is the power of your panel at each time. Try to integrate that (use the integration block) and you get the energy that came out of your solar panel in a year period. The energy that was received is the integration of solar irradiation. But this is expressed in W/m^2 so calculate it with your solar panel's area (width x length).So now the REAL mean efficiency of this solar panel in YOUR specific area of the world is Energy Out/Energy InI do not know if have been more thorough or less than I should have but I believe this is good way to compare solar panels.Get the info and calculate the constants from first solar panel and then simulate to get real mean efficiency.Do the same for the second, third etc solar panel of the market.Compare the efficiencies and choose the one with the best efficiency!Be ware that efficiency is not the only factor. A good guarantee of 25years of operation should be preferred than a 20 years guarantee with slightly less performance!</p>","matlab code for improving transient stability of multimachine po,mppt,real efficiency,solar cell,solar panel,two diode model,9bus power system,matlab code for improving transient stability of multimachine po,matlab code for transient stability of multimachine3machines,9bus power system",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2311148-george12thd-p,2010-05-07 13:26:08.000000,2010-05-07 13:26:08.000000,5,4,4.0,15,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/27528/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2010, george12thd P

Additional notes accompanying the demo. These notes have been intentionally kept fuzzy and listed in random order as it is expected that you will explore the model to understand all the components and their interaction with each other. 1. The demo simulates a 2 vs. 2 robot soccer match. The robots are assumed to be heavier than the football. Thus, any collision between the ball and the robots is perfectly elastic. The robot’s motion is not impacted by the collision. 2. Collision among robots is not implemented as they are considered as point masses. 3. Collision modeling in all cases is assumed to be as a spring contact model. When the object colliding with a boundary comes close to that boundary, a force proportional to the negative of the ""penetration distance"" is computed. 4. The strategy subsystems are implemented as referenced models. This was done intentionally so that competing teams could protect their strategies and run the simulation against each other. You can use the model reference protected mode to generate a mdlp file instead of mdl file (introduced in R2009b): &gt;&gt; Simulink.ModelReference.protect('Team_1_Strategy') and &gt;&gt; Simulink.ModelReference.protect('Team_2_Strategy') 5. Robot dynamics are simple dynamics of a point mass. However, the mass is inversely proportional to the battery power or ""stamina"" of the robot. Some damping is also put into the system to avoid too much overshoot. Also, each time the robot actuates itself or brakes, it incurs a small power loss thereby lowering its endurance in the game. 6. Positional coordinates in the system are 2D i.e. (x,y). The signal dimensions have been set explicitly. Click on any of the output ports-&gt;signal attributes of the masked subsystems to see the dimensions. 7. Ball dynamics has a simple implementation- same ""spring-based"" contact dynamics. From the ball's point of view, there are five contact forces to be accounted for: contacts with the 4 robots and those of the boundaries. 8. Observe that the solver has been changed to ode15s which is a stiff solver. The reason for this is that there is stiffness present in the system because of the contact/collision modeling with high spring constants. This can give rise to modes with relatively different dynamics. With a ode45 solver, the faster modes will force the adaptive solver to take smaller steps slowing the simulation down. ode15s ignores some of these fast dynamics. 9. All the icon drawing commands on the robot dynamics subsystems were implemented using the MATLAB patch commands. These were taken from the flags demo by Mike Woodward: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8856-flags"">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8856-flags</a> Use other flags to customize this. 10. 2D animation was done using Simulink 3D Animation. The field was textured with a grass image and a viewpoint was so selected so that it looked as 2D. The ""GOAL"" text was kept behind the field. The moment, a goal is scored, this text is translated to the front giving a TV effect. Texturing was also used to paint the bodies of the robots with the flags. You will have to change the images in order to change these. 11. Play around with the strategy subsystems to see if you can come up with efficient strategies to score goals early. Note that each of the teams has full knowledge of the others' positions and those of the ball. They also have knowledge of the remaining power in their team's batteries. There is no velocity information available. 12. You need Simulink 3D Animation installed to view animation.Exercises for you to try out: 1. How can you use Stateflow to implement a finite state machine that uses a mix of attack and defensive strategies based on ball location? 2. What block in Simulink should you use to input a new signal into these strategy subsystems so that time elapsed since the start of the game can be measured and hence be used as part of the strategy? 3. Identify the contents inside the MAT file used in the demo. What is the ""type"" of the contents of the data inside the file? Identify the function that loads this MAT file. Why did we need these data objects in our model? 4. Explore the possibility of using control strategies, like PID, to improve robot tracking</p>","animation,ball,collaborative,control,football,game,introduction,machine,multagent,multiple,robocup,simulator,soccer,visualization,webinar,3d,animation,ball,collaborative,competition,control,fine,football,game,hockey,ice,introduction,machine,multagent,multiple,robocup,robot,robot soccer,robotics,simulator,simulink,soccer,state,theory,visualization,webinar,robot soccer,battery_system_management,power_electronics_control,football",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1297391-simulink-dude,2016-09-01 15:15:14.000000,2016-09-01 15:15:14.000000,7,4,4.0,4,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/28196/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2010, The MathWorks, Inc.

356,28386,Modeling and Control of Multi Stage Rolling Mill Process,Parasar Kodati,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28386-modeling-and-control-of-multi-stage-rolling-mill-process,This demo shows plant modeling and controller design for a multi stage rolling mill process. ,"<p>Sheet Rolling Mill processes involve progressive thickness reduction of continuous sheet metal in multiple stages. Some of the control variables of interest are exit thickness, throughput and the tension in the sheet as it passes from one stage to the other. Following page has links to the webinar series that cover plant modeling and controller design aspects: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/programs/rolling_mill_webinars/index.html"">http://www.mathworks.com/programs/rolling_mill_webinars/index.html</a> This demo model takes advantage of physical modeling tools to model interaction of the sheet with rollers (for thickness reduction) and looper mechanisms (for tension regulation) as well as electric and hydraulic actuators driving the different machine elements. The plant modeling builds on the single stage rolling mill model implemented by Alec Stothert: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13978-simulink%C2%AE-for-industrial-control-of-a-sheet-metal-rolling-application"">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13978-simulink%C2%AE-for-industrial-control-of-a-sheet-metal-rolling-application</a>   A multi loop control architecture[1] is used to control the process variables using a combination of PID and other higher order controllers. A supervisory logic for fault detection and recovery is also implemented using Stateflow. Simulink PLC Coder can be used to generate IEC 61131-3 structured text from the supervisory logic and other controllers to deply on a PLC controller. The plant modeling can be easily extended for a more general  web processing application involving any other material like paper, carpet, tape etc.                      [1] I.S. Choi, J.A.

This demo attempts to answer those kinds of questions.Notes on this submission:1. The approach is to represent the equations using Simulink blocks and then use MATLAB graphics to plot the results. The advantage of using the graphical approach is with the ability to customize the solver configurations and step through the solution in time. 2. The design pattern shows a two stage model in which the integrator plays the role of integrating the ODE.  The terms are collected and fed into this integrator. 3. As mentioned in the webinar, we use vector processing capabilities of the integrator to process the three terms simultaneously.4. The concept of feedback is important as the solver solves for the next step in the simulation based on its current states. 5. We use MATLAB S-Functions to incorporate visualization code for the MATLAB GUI. Also, observe that we move the camera around so that you get a good visual of how the 3D curve looks like. There is also a model that uses a Level-1 S-function for those who may be interested in it for legacy reasons.6. Look into the MATLAB S-Function code as to how a red marker that acts like a tracer is created.7. The S-Function block was modeled as a discrete block with a sampling time so that a high fidelity plot could be obtained(at the cost of performance). There is a performance trade-off that you should look out for when visualizing results.8. Look into the code for the various S-Functions and read the comments to understand how the code is structured.9. Notes on the Lorenz Attractor: The study of strange attractors began with the publication by E. N. Lorenz- ""Deterministic non-periodic flow""(Journal of Atmospheric Science, 20:130-141, 1963). In the process of investigating meteorological models, Edward Lorenz found that very small truncation or rounding errors in his algorithms produced large changes in the resulting predictions. This led to the study of ""strange"" or chaotic attractors. One crude way to visualize attractors is a set such that if during the evolution of the dynamics of the system, one of the states hits a point in that set, it will continue to remain in that set. From a simulation point of view, it is interesting to see the existence of such sets for certain nonlinear dynamical systems. If this attractor is chaotic meaning it has sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then it is called a strange attractor. It was particularly an interesting result which he observed that for parameter values sigma=10, beta=8/3, and rho=28, the solutions start revolving about two repelling equilibirum points at (sqrt(72), sqrt(72.27).The number of times the solution revolves around one equilibirum point before switching to the other has no discernible pattern. More information on this can be obtained in a standard introductory nonlinear systems text.10. Questions to ponder about:a. How would you project this 3D trajectory onto a arbitrary plane surface and visualize it during the simulation? Would the trajectory  intersect itself?b. How would you visualize the Poincare map?c. How would you compute the number of turns the red marker makes around the equilibrium point before switching to the other? Could this number be used to generate random numbers?  </p>","3d,attractor,chaos,differential,equation,graphics,lorenz,matlab,ode,sfunction,simulink,visualization",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1297391-simulink-dude,2016-09-01 15:15:39.000000,2016-09-01 15:15:39.000000,4,5,3.0,10,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/28451/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2010, The MathWorks, Inc.

The model computes the eigenvectos (modes) at various speeds of rotation incorporating various effects like gyroscopics, stiffness of bearings.  The results are presented using 2d and 3d graphics.Please use this package for educational purposes only, I do not support industries (with this free code) and do not support ministries of ‘energy’ anywhere. Students are welcome to ask questions and I will do my best to help beginners researching rotordynamics.  Please do not send long assignments to me because this would mean I will have less time to ride my mountain bike....  This software package was written mostly during the summers of 1995,1998 (and some bugs are thus 10 years old :-)   Do not despair! Some parts work correctly and the graphics is reasonably nice. I use the package myself during teaching (rotordynamics).

It describes useful workflows for approaching the task of data-based modeling using System Identification Toolbox™ . Two modeling approaches are described:1. Black box modeling: case where you cannot derive the exact mathematical representation of the system from physical considerations; the form of the model as well as the values of its coefficients is extracted from data.2. Grey-box modeling: the equations of motion relating the input and output variables are known, but the values of various physical constants in the equations are unknown; the data is then used to find the values of those unknowns only.The emphasis is on the black box modeling approach. It is shown that even though no a priori knowledge of model structure is required, it is often helpful to have some intuition about the nature of the system and to use this knowledge to fine-tune the configuration of model structures.

371,28812,Tabular Expression Toolbox,Colin Eles,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28812-tabular-expression-toolbox,A tool for creating tabular expressions in Matlab/Simulink integrating checking with PVS and CVC3.,"<p>Tabular Expression ToolboxTabular Expressions (also called ""tables"") provide a precise and concise way to represent mathematical conditional expressions. Tables have been shown to be useful in the documenting and analysing of software systems. The graphical layout of tabular expressions allow for unambiguous interpretation and intuitive inspection of table correctness. In order for a table to be considered proper it must satisfy two properties, disjointness (no two conditions are true at the same time) and completeness (there is at least one condition that is true.) Tabular expressions have been used on numerous industrial projects, including safety critical applications.We present a Tabular Expression Toolbox for Matlab/Simulink. The toolbox provides a graphical interface for the creation and manipulation of tabular expressions. The tool allows for the checking of completeness and consistency of tables by leveraging the power of the PVS theorem prover and/or the SMT solver CVC3. By generating a PVS theory of the expression, and using the PVS proof system, we can prove that a table is both disjoint and complete. CVC3 can be used in a similar manner to PVS. For failed proofs the tool will attempt to generate a counter example, which will clearly show to the user why their table is not proper. We provide support for both these tools as they are based on different technologies and therefore have different strengths and weaknesses which we can take advantage of. In order to get the maximum utility of the toolbox we recommend installing both tools. We feel this Table Toolbox brings some needed formalism to Simulink models.We now support proving tables using floating point types in PVS. See documentation for more details.The Table Toolbox contains a Simulink block, which when opened allows for the editing of a tabular expression, upon saving a table, the block's inputs and outputs are updated while generating Embedded Matlab Code equivalent to the tabular expression. The tool will also run from the Toolbox menu in Matlab, allowing users to create tables, check them, then generate an m-file equivalent to the table. The tools will work without having PVS or CVC3 installed on users machine, however they will not be able to automatically check that a table is proper.Features:* Integration with PVS theorem prover* Integration with CVC3 SMT Solver* Graphical Counter Example Generation* 1-Dimensional and 2-Dimensional Tables* Nested headers along vertical dimension* single output or multiple output* Compatibility with code generation* Prove tables with floating point inputsFor installation instructions see README.txtSee included Help files for more information on using the tool.New features, additional documentation, and bug fixes will continue to be released.

The model blocks are proprietary and seldom shared in the open. A benchmark problem was designed as part of a research activity to test out certain test case generation techniques. This model was also used as a problem for the test case generation methodology training classes. Trainees, normally fresh graduates from colleges, were asked to design manual test cases to find out the errors embedded in the model. The control system blocks are typical of the ones used in a flight control system or an automobile control system. It is a combination of linear filters, integrators, non-linear blocks like rate limiters and lookup table. There is a combination of logic and time dependency in terms of persistence blocks. These are however more complex for generating test cases as explained below. The blocks have been selected and placed to ensure that the students exercise some thought process and understand the underlying functionality of the control system blocks.This problem is being provided as open source to the Control System test community. This we believe is a first of its kind and we hope to provide more benchmark problems as we go along comparing Taguchi method of testing. Users are free to try out the Matlab or other commercial test tools against this model. We would like to hear about your experience in using this benchmark problem.Benchmark ProblemThe benchmark model is called compete_2010.mdl. This is a Simulink model with a test harness, which takes in 10 inputs from the workspace named Inp1 to Inp10. It has 7 outputs, which come out as a vector in a variable simout (refer Figure 1). There is a Matlab code, which is an exact replica of the model in code form (file model00001.m). This has undergone more than 20,000 test runs and both model and code match very well. There is a variation of this with instrumentation for coverage called model00001_c.m. This file has a variable COVERAGE, which collects the line, condition and logic coverage. There is a Simulink model with 17 mutants injected into the model subsystems called compete.mdl. This has the model and the mutants in the same file. Each mutant block has a single mutant embedded into it. The output of the mutant block and the original model is compared and is available as error in the scope. The model output is Output in workspace and the mutant outputs are available as Output1 to Output17 in the workspace. Automated mutant generationThe model was used as a benchmark problem to verify random test case generation techniques. A novel method of test case generation using Taguchi was also used to generate test cases. An automated mutant generator was developed for the Simulink and Matlab code. These Matlab scripts generate all combinations of mutants for the Simulink and Matlab code. An OR gate, as an example, would be replaced by an AND gate, XOR gate etc in each mutant file. Each mutant file will have only one mutant. The mutant description is provided as a text file for the Simulink mutant models. The mutant Matlab code has the change description as the first line in the mutant. The script could generate 414 Simulink mutant and 7592 mutants for the Matlab code.</p>","aerospace,automated tests,automotive,benchmark,coverage,metrics,model based,mutation,problem,random,simulink,testing,validation,verification",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2222682-yogananda-jeppu,2010-10-06 04:41:21.000000,2010-10-06 04:41:21.000000,1,1,4.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/28952/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2010, Jeppu Yogananda, Prasad K, Chethan CU

The degree of slowdown is controllable via a Speedup parameter. 1) The block is implemented using an M S-function, so it works on any supported Simulink platform. It does not support code generation. 2) The block uses the MATLAB PAUSE function to slow down the simulation. The PAUSE command gives up the processor during the pause, so system performance does not degrade. 3) The M-S function illustrates how to use nested functions to simplify the code. The matching between simulation time and elapsed real time is approximate, with expected differences on the order of 10 to 30 milliseconds. This limitation is due to difficulties of precise timing with a multitasking operating system. --------RELATED FX ENTRIESThe following FX entries also implement ""real time"" functionality for Simulink.

They are Karaoke.Surround Sound,Flanging,Reverb,Left/right Channel selection, Echo , Chorus,  Bass ,Treble using 10 band EQUALISER AND IMPIMENTED  IN  T1 DSK 6713  .PREPARED BY:SANGHANI HARDIKBHUCHARA KARTIKTUSHAR DAVEKACHA JAYSANGUIDED BY : PROF. BHAVIN S. SEDANI(V.V.P ENGG. CLG. RAJKOT.)1. ORIGINAL SONG AMPLIFIER:In this the original song is passed through a gain block and thus amplified without any alteration.2 KARAOKE:This is the facility which is useful  when we want to sing the song from the lyrics . whenever any audio recording is done music is recorded differently in the left and the right channel  due to the available Technique known as Multitrack recording  but vocals are recorded equally so that if we give 180 deg phase shift to the left and right channel  and than added so that the vocals are suppressed and only the  music will remain.3 BASS :In this the bass (low frequency e.g. Tablas, Drums etc.,) components of the audio signal while high frequency music components are significantly attenuated. For that, this we have used 10 IIR Band pass Butterworth (10 band equalizer)Filter of order 2(designed using FDA tool) which finally boost low frequency end. 4 TREBLE :In this the treble i.e. high frequency compoments are boosted while the bass components are reduced in amplitude.  For that,  we have used 10 IIR Band pass Butterworth (10 band equalizer)Filter of order 2(designed using FDA tool) which finally boost high frequency end. 5 LEFT ACTIVATE: Here from the two available channels i.e. left and right one of them LEFT  is selected and by using submatrix block and other is suppressed6 RIGHT ACTIVATE: Here from the two available channels i.e. left and right one of them RIGHT is selected and by using submatrix block and other is suppressed7 ECHO:Echo is repetition of a sound by reflection of sound waves from The place which is greater then 17m away .which can be produced by using the integer delay to the same sample after the time greater than 0.1 sec(perception of  human ear to store the sound heard by us)8 CHORUS:The chorus effect is especially easy to hear when listening to a choir or string ensemble. A choir has multiple people singing each part A string ensemble has multiple violinists and possibly multiples of other stringed instruments. When individual singers or violins play the same part, the chorus effect can be heard. Here we have implimented so as 3 different singers are singing with 3 different instruments we have done this repeating the same samples after giving the very small integer delays  9. REVERBERATION :Reverberation effect is experienced when any signal coming from the source instead of travellin acc. To the inverse square law reflected back at the distance less than 17m and the delay time between two same sample is less than 0.1 sec(perception of the human ear)10.SURROUND SOUND :Surround sound effect is one in which we can hear  the  sound like a goodest quality.At a time one is the original song which is available in one channel and after 20 ms delay sound is available in other channel. Here we are using the principle of  perception of  hearing.</p>","audio processing,audio processing,audio processing",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2190635-hardik-sanghani,2010-11-02 07:05:32.000000,2010-11-02 07:05:32.000000,1,1,3.0,3,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/29238/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2010, hardik sanghani

Provided that you have a 3G mobile phone or a laptop with you, you can get notifications of your model's simulation progress, anywhere in the world, by connecting to your GMAIL account.'Installation'---------------This small project is consisted of two main files, one simulink model (.mdl) and one Matlab code program (.m).In order for them to work properly, they must co-exist in the MATLAB's assigned working folder (for example C:\Program Files\MATLAB\bin) or any other folder assigned as the main working folder for such a purpose.Intergration to your simulink project-----------------------------------------------Just copy the main subsystem block 'SPEM' on your open project.Then double click on the block in order to enter the notification values you wish. The 'Simulation Time' must correspond to the simulation time of your project, and the 'Notification Step Percentage' on the portion of elapsed time/percentage you wish to be notified. For example, if the Simulation Time is 73 (seconds) and the Notification Step Percentage is 5 (%) then you will be notified by email 20 times in total (each time for every 73/20=3.65 seconds of elapsed simulation time).Every email (starting from the one at 5%) will have one text file attached (progress.txt). This file will hold the value of the current percentage that the running simulation will be 'currently' processing. The last email notification will not have a text file attached but just a subject that will notify you about the simulation completion. ('Simulation Completed')Considerations--------------------The SPEM block is compatible with all GMAIL accounts, so provided that you have one, you just have to enter your email address and email password to the appropriate places into the .m file's code.You will have to replace the phrases '<a href=""mailto:your.account@gmail.com"">your.account@gmail.com</a>' and 'your_password' with the ones that correspond to your gmail account. There are in total 3 fields that you have to type your email address and 1 that you have to type your email password.The code lines with the associated fields begin with the following characters :* mail = '<a href=""mailto:your.account@gmail.com"">your.account@gmail.com</a>';* password = 'your_password';* sendmail('<a href=""mailto:your.account@gmail.com"">your.account@gmail.com</a>',...Please note that you MUST keep the quotes!</p>","3g,email,gmail,iphone,mandourarakis,mobile,model,notification,percentage,progress,push,report,simulation,simulink,spem,unattended",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1322555-ioannis-mandourarakis,2010-11-02 14:38:38.000000,2010-11-02 14:38:38.000000,0,0,0.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/29251/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2010, CyberWalker

395,29857,VU-LEGO Real Time Target,James Peyton Jones,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29857-vu-lego-real-time-target,A user-friendly Blockset for embedding real time Simulink designs on the LEGO Mindstorms NXT brick.,"<p>The Villanova University LEGO Real Time Target (VU-LRT) enables rapid implementation of Simulink-based designs on the LEGO Mindstorms NXT platform.  It is similar in aim to the Embedded Coder Robot (ECRobot) package by Takashi Chikamasa, but is more consistent with the Real Time Workshop development pathway, and is less constrained by ECRobot's function call / data store architecture.  An automated installer is shipped with VU-LRT - see the README.pdf in the download.  Examples include motor speed control, a line-following robot, and a re-implementation of the NXTway-GS self-balancing two-wheeled robot.***NOTE***VU-LRT was developed as an NSF and MathWorks funded project aimed at exploiting Simulink code generation tools and low-cost hardware platforms, (such as the LEGO MindStorms NXT), for educational purposes.  In R2012a, the MathWorks added code generation capabilities to core Simulink without the need for additional toolboxes thereby providing a more cost-effective solution for bringing rapid prototyping into the classroom.  The MathWorks also provided a free LEGO MindStorms NXT Target support package which delivers similar functionality to VU-LRT, but which is now professionally supported by the MathWorks.   As a result, VU-LRT will no longer be actively maintained after the R2011b release and the authors will be transitioning their own courses to the new R2012a Simulink and MathWorks LEGO MindStorms NXT Target support package.  The authors wish to thank the many enthusiastic supporters of VU-LRT who have developed so many creative projects with VU-LRT.  We hope and expect that this creativity will continue to expand and flourish using the new MathWorks tools that have become available.</p>","ecrobot,embedded,lego,mindstorms,nxt,nxtway,real time workshop,robot,robotics,vulrt,electric_motor_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/77777-james-peyton-jones,2012-04-23 11:38:20.000000,2012-04-23 11:38:20.000000,17,15,5.0,8,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/29857/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2010, James Peyton Jones

431,31142,International Flight Route Planning Simulator using Aerospace Blockset,Simulink Dude,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31142-international-flight-route-planning-simulator-using-aerospace-blockset,Example that shows how you can visualize airline routes on the globe.,"<p>In this demo, with an ordered list of cities with latitudes and longitudes as input, the simulator computes the shortest path between the two consecutive cities and then animates the aircraft motion on 3D earth while tracing the trajectory. Observe that this is an example where the analysis of the data is done in MATLAB and the data is ""played back"" in Simulink.Also, attached to the plane is a North-East-Down (NED) frame, that gives a better understanding of aircraft coordinate systems.Key design considerations:1. The image of the earth that was used to texture the spherical earth was from NASA's 2002 Blue Marble imagesPlease note that calibrating the latitudes and longitudes on this spehrical earth requires that you use a mercator projection with aspect ratio 2:1. 2. The great circles joining any two cities were computed using the Mapping Toolbox's track2 function:<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/map/ref/track2.htmlThe"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/map/ref/track2.htmlThe</a> number of sampling points chosen were scaled accordingly to allow for uniformity in airplane motion. 3. The set of latitudes and longitudes were input to a LLA to ECEF block to compute the translational coordinates of the aircraft with the NED frame attached:<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/aeroblks/llatoecefposition.html4"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/aeroblks/llatoecefposition.html4</a>. To compute the orientation of the NED frame, the Direction Cosine Matrix to Quaternion block was used before mapping it to VRML rotational coordinates:<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/aeroblks/directioncosinematrixtoquaternions.htmlThe"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/aeroblks/directioncosinematrixtoquaternions.htmlThe</a> use of quaternions avoids the issues such as those encountered in this demo:<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/261235"">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/261235</a>. The VR Tracer block from Simulink 3D Animation traces the trajectory in the 3D world. It is put inside an enabled subsystem to downsample the number of trajectory points and thus save memroy for visualization(each point plotted is a 3D object)Thought provoking questions:1. Observe how thethe orientation of the aircraft is computed in the NED frame. How does this accuracy depend on the largest allowable number of sampling points i.e. t_scaled?2. How accurate is the aircraft orientation for routes that pass over the poles? </p>","pick of the week,potw,3d,aerospace,air,animation,blockset,ecef,flight,ned,pick of the week,planning,potw,reality,route,simulator,traffic,virtual",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1297391-simulink-dude,2016-09-01 15:17:51.000000,2016-09-01 15:17:51.000000,1,4,5.0,11,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/31142/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2011, The MathWorks, Inc.

For a given m, the length of all the Reed-Solomon codes composed of m-bit symbols is 2m - 1. For example, for 8-bit symbols, the length of the Reed-Solomon codes is 28 - 1 = 255. A complete Reed-Solomon code consists of two parts: the data part and the parity part. For a Reed-Solomon code of n symbols, the first k symbols is the data part, which is the information to be protected against corruption, and the following (n-k) symbols is the parity part, which is calculated based on the data part. Such a Reed-Solomon code is referred to as an (n, k) Reed-Solomon code, or RS(n,k) code. The number of parity symbols is (n-k), usually an even number represented as 2t. A Reed-Solomon code with 2t parity symbols has the capability of correcting up to t error symbols. </p>","16psk,awgn,reed solomon",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2701842-khan-sadaf,2011-07-07 13:03:03.000000,2011-07-07 13:03:03.000000,2,0,0.0,3,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/32127/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2011, SADAF KHAN

475,32210,Dynamical Systems Toolbox,Etienne  Coetzee,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32210-dynamical-systems-toolbox,Bifurcation analysis of dynamical systems. Integration of AUTO bifurcation software into MATLAB.,"<p>**Background**This is a MATLAB version of AUTO, where we have integrated AUTO into MATLAB via mex functions. This toolbox is aimed at researchers familiar with AUTO, but also engineers that would like toapply these techniques. One of the biggest reasons why Dynamical Systems Theory is not being applied widely in an engineering context, is mainly due to the lack of bifurcation software that integrates with relative ease with existing toolsets. We therefore tried to address this issue by incorporating AUTO into MATLAB, and thus the Dynamical Sytems Toolbox was built. We hope that it would be useful teaching tool and can help popularise the methods amongst the engineering community.Ample examples are also needed for a person new to the field, hence more aerospace examples will follow in future releases.At this stage we are still in the process of adding several engineering examples to the toolbox. Feel free to develop some examples for inclusion into the toolbox. There are template files that you can use for inclusion of your own examples.**Souce Control**Source files are controlled on github athttps://github.com/ecoetzee/Dynamical-Systems-Toolbox**System Requirements**1. MATLAB R2009A or higher2. Intel Visual Fortran 9.1 or higher for compiling on Windows, if needed.3. GCC 4.3.1 or higher for compiling on Linux.**Authors**This toolbox was written by Etienne Coetzee, Phani Thota and James Rankin from the University of Bristol. Obviously, credit must also be given to the authors of AUTO, Esebius Doedel et al.**Main features**1.  Look and feel of MATLAB. 2.  Extensive use of objects. 3.  Can be run in the new mode, or still with all the old AUTO files (.c,.7,.8.9) familiar     to the user. 4.  Robust error checking. 5.  Additional outputs can be detected and also passed out to MATLAB variables. 6.  Any of the MATLAB toolsets can be used, i.e. the Symbolic toolbox, Simulink etc. 7.  Similar notations to that of AUTO. A person familiar with AUTO should find it     straightforward to pick up the new toolsets. 8.  Also works with the student version of MATLAB. 9.  Ample documentation. 10. Templates files for people willing to contribute their own examples for inclusion     into the demos. **Drawbacks**1.  Limit Cycles are at least an order of magnitude slower. We had to make a trade-off     between robustness and speed. We therefore decided that if we want to popularise the methods,     then the code should work, and people should not have to struggle with decoding it. 2.  No ample enginering examples yet.**Installation Instructions**To install the toolbox follow these steps:1.  Download the toolbox and unzip.2.  Open MATLAB and change to the directory where the toolbox was unzipped.3.  Run the program  installdynasys.m; A user interface will appear.4.  If you have admin rights keep the default values and install. The toolbox will be     installed in the MATLAB installation directory.5.  If you do not have admin rights, install the toolbox to a directory where you have     access rights. A startup.m file will be created in this directory.6.  Close MATLAB, and restart.7.  Type dynasysroot and dynasyshelproot at the command line. If these commands are     working, it should indicate where the toolbox components were installed. If not,     something has gone wrong. Check that the paths are correctly defined.8.  The Dynamical Systems Toolbox should appear on the menu. If not, either the paths     were not defined correctly, or the info.xml file in the **$dynasysroot/toolbox/dynasys**     directory has the wrong information on line 10. Add the correct path to the documentation     directory **$dynasysdocroot/toolbox/dynasys**.9.  Close MATLAB and restart.**Restrictions**1.  We have only managed to compile on Windows with Intel Fortran 9.1 or higher. Also now     possible to use on Linux with gcc 4.3 or higher.2.  I am not able to make many updates because I am trying to finish my PhD, hence assume     that the software will not be frequently updated.**Additional Resources**The following link provides more information on aerospace applications at the University of Bristol.<a href=""http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~ec1099/"">http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~ec1099/</a></p>","toolbox,aerospace,bifurcation,coninuation,dynamical systems,fold,hopf,limit cycle",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1541964-etienne-coetzee,2011-07-13 13:47:16.000000,2011-07-13 13:47:16.000000,60,8,4.0,34,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/32210/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2011, Etienne  Coetzee, Phani Thota, James Rankin, Esebius Doedel

477,32246,Dual Clutch Transmission Model in Simulink,Steve Miller,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32246-dual-clutch-transmission-model-in-simulink,Model of a dual-clutch transmission with MATLAB scripts for optimizing the shift schedule.,"<p>This file contains a dual-clutch transmission model built using Simscape and Simscape Driveline that can be configured for control algorithm development or optimization tests. The clutch states and pre-selection of the gears via dog clutches is controlled by a state machine modeled in Stateflow. Model variants for the transmission and vehicle dynamics can be selected using configurable subsystems. MATLAB scripts demonstrate how to optimize a shift schedule for maximum fuel economy, and how to speed that process using parallel computing. This model can be configured for hardware-in-the-loop testing.  Please read the README.txt file to get started.

In this example, we have two conveyor belts that have motions perpendicular to each other. Furthermore, a package needs to be mounted onto the conveyors and transferred across them as well by three gantries.Key points to keep in mind:1. The SimEvents model is used to model the environmental input to the conveyor belt system. A gated release of the packages is obtained through control from the assemly line that signals if the conveyor_x is indeed free. Furthermore, each entity is assigned a unique identification number (UID) to keep track of its flow through the statechart. 2. The Stateflow chart is used as a diagram to sequence the states. All concurrent motions of the various elements in the system are modeled as parallel states.3. The transfers are also modeled as parallel states with timed delays to create a simple loading motion. Observe how the uid values are reset only after the sequence is done to keep the various states of the system in synchronous.4. The Integration subsystem is a placeholder for modeling additional dynamics that can be incorporated by the modeler.5. The Animation Logic MATLAB function has been designed to simply the animation. At any point in time, there are only two blocks possible on the assembly line. By switching on/off the transparencies of the blocks, a uniform motion of the blocks can be obtained. This is much simpler than having to create a new block dynamically using the PROTO function.Questions to ponder about:1. The maximum queue capacity is 25. At what value of the velocities(forward &amp; backward) for both the conveyors will the queue length never exceed 10?2. How does the result in (1) change if you use a uniform distribution for the time-based entity generation? </p>","des,descrete event simulation,discrete event,3d,animation,assembly,automation,conveyor,des,descrete event simulation,diagram,discrete,discrete event,event,eventbased,factory,flow,industrial,line,manufacturing,network,packaging,plc,queue,reality,sequence,simevents,traffic,virtual,visualization,workshop,3d,conveyor",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1297391-simulink-dude,2016-09-01 15:19:14.000000,2016-09-01 15:19:14.000000,3,4,5.0,4,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/32403/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2011, The MathWorks, Inc.

Team 1 has a strategy that is implemented as different modes in a state chart where the collective behavior of the two robots switches between aggressive and passive plays. The criteria that determines the switching is based on opponent positions and residual energy. Team 2 uses a rather simple strategy with one robot always attacking and the other simply defending by blocking shots. 2. For each team, both robots upload their energy values on a shared channel and download actuator command signals on another shared channel from a centralized station.3. Observe that the outcomes and game play are different each time you run the simulation. How can you explain this paradox given that all the initial positions and strategy of the robots are the same? What is causing the non-deterministic system level behavior in the system?4. Under the non-deterministic circumstances outlined above, is it possible to design (assuming existence) an algorithm that guarantees a 90% confidence that team 1 will always win? If such an algorithm does not exist, can you prove why?Please make sure you use R2011b as SimEvents underwent a major update that requires new blocks (gateway block) for this demo to work.</p>","3d,animation,ball,collaborative,competition,control,fine,football,game,hockey,ice,introduction,machine,multagent,multiple,robocup,robot,robot soccer,robotics,simevents,simulator,simulink,soccer,state,theory,visualization,webinar",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1297391-simulink-dude,2016-09-01 15:19:22.000000,2016-09-01 15:19:22.000000,1,3,5.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/32835/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2011, The MathWorks, Inc.

It uses a planetary device, which transmits the mechanical motive force from the engine, the motor and the generator by allocating and combining them.The Internal Combustion Engine subsystem models a 57 kW @ 6000 rpm gasoline fuel engine with speed governor.The Vehicle Dynamics subsystem models all the mechanical parts of the vehicle.The Energy Management Subsystem (EMS) determines the reference signals for the electric motor drive, the electric generator drive and the internal combustion engine in order to distribute accurately the power from these three sources.This demonstration was previously available in SimPowerSystems Version 5.4 (R2011a).

To satisfy this requirement, an appropriate control force profile must be determined.The stamping operation comprises three modes: (i) the movement of the component toward the board, (ii) the holding against the board, and (iii) the release of the component.In the holding mode, the numerical simulation must handle the large reaction force that is exerted by the board. This results in a time constant much faster than in the two other modes. So, the system is considered numerically stiff.A variable step solver that is necessary to efficiently handle stiff behavior is explicitly modeled. Because the solver model is discrete, Simulink Design Verifier can be applied to the problem of finding a required control force profile.Details about the theoretical background can be found in the article ""A Computational Model of Time for Stiff Hybrid Systems Applied to Control Synthesis"" by P.J. Mosterman, J. Zander, G. Hamon, and B. Denckla as published in the August 2011 issue of the IFAC journal Control Engineering Practice.</p>","control design,control synthesis,hybrid systems,manufacturing,model checking,modeling,numerical integration,simulation",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/869405-pieter-mosterman,2016-09-01 15:19:31.000000,2016-09-01 15:19:31.000000,0,1,5.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/33531/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2011, The MathWorks, Inc.

Taking the modulus of the free running simulation ""Clock"" with the ""Period"", gives a triangular wave whose frequency is set by the ""Period"" input.2. The multiplication of the ""Period"" with ""PulseWidth""(in fraction instead of percentage), gives the On-Period of the Pulse.3. Comparing the above generated triangular wave with this On-Period results into the Pulse waveform of desired frequency and pulse width. This is further scaled by the ""Amplitude"" input to achieve the desired peak magnitude.4. The desired phase shift is achieved simply by:   a) subtracting the ""PhaseDelay"" input from the ""Clock"" and   b) using a switch to turn the ""Amplitude"" to zero till the ""Clock"" gets greater than the ""PhaseDelay"".With special thanks to Pravallika Vinnakota, Mathworks Application Support Engineer.</p>","programmable,pulse generator,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/982307-syed-kazmi,2012-03-30 10:42:09.000000,2012-03-30 10:42:09.000000,11,14,4.0,44,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/35922/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2011, Syed Kazmi

It is now possible (but not demonstrated here) to include a second HVDC link in the network. A script controls the whole process and iterates until the convergence criteria for the AC and DC load flows have been reached simultaneously. The parameters used by the script are defined in the block Sequential Load Flow Param embedded in the network model LF_AC29bus_HVDCdemo_V2_1.slx.The load flows results are printed in report file(s) specified by the user. To execute the script, open the model and click “Compute” in the block Sequential Load Flow Para.

The inverter output is connected to the 25-kV, 40 MVA, 50-Hz systemthrough a 2200 V / 25 kV transformer.Each 3-level leg of the 3-phase 400-kW inverter comprises three commercial half-bridge IGBT modules. Phase-A leg is implemented using the  “Half-bridge IGBT with Loss Calculation” block provided in a SPS local library. Based on the thermal characteristics of the selected IGBT module, both switching and conduction losses are calculated. Thermal blocks of the Simscape foundation library are used to model the heat dissipation provided by the heat sink.  The simulation illustrates the achievable output power versus switching frequency for the 3-phase, 3-level inverter and compares results with the manufacturer’s reference document. A Help file containing useful information on the model is also included.

Unfortunately I got only Debug binaries to work.2) QwtScopeDev - this project compiles the same code to an exe for easier testing and development.The MEX file will be compiled into the Simulink/ directory. test.mdl is an example of using the S-Function.Because I should not upload binary files, you need to make sure you have the following DLL files in path: qwtmathmld.dll qwtd.dll QtCore4d.dll QtSvgd4.dll QtGuid4.dll msvcp100d.dll msvcr100d.dll msvcr90d.dll msvcp90d.dll msvcm90d.dllIf you have any questions, ask them in the comments and I will hopefully be able to help you.</p>","measurement,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3444424-ronald-tammepold,2012-04-18 17:22:11.000000,2012-04-18 17:22:11.000000,0,0,0.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/36266/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2012, Ronald

Communication between SWI-Prolog and Simulink uses JPL (Java Interface to Prolog). JPL is a library using JNI (Java Native Interface) providing a bidirectional interface between Java and SWI-Prolog. The SWI-Prolog Interface block allows you to create simulation with expert systems using PROLOG code. With this block can be read PROLOG source file and loads the clauses in SWI-Prolog environment. The clauses are called through a PROLOG query that is an input parameter of the SWI-Prolog Interface block.The PROLOG query uses ''u'' as the input variable name and ''y'' as the output variable name. In the case of queries with multiple solutions, this block will only return the first solution found.The SWI-Prolog and JPL (Java Interface to Prolog) configurations are showed on the pdf file.The attached file contains a simple on-off tank level control with prolog-based expert system example using The SWI-Prolog Interface block.Marcelo Augusto Costa FernandesDCA - CT - <a href=""mailto:UFRNmfernandes@dca.ufrn.br"">UFRNmfernandes@dca.ufrn.br</a></p>","expert system,expert system,java,jpl,prolog,simulink,swiprolog",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2756909-marcelo-fernandes,2016-09-14 01:10:25.000000,2016-09-14 01:10:25.000000,0,1,5.0,2,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/36516/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2012, Marcelo Fernandes

679,36938,Autonomous 4-Wheel Robot Light Tracker - Arduino Mega 2560,Dan Lluch,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/36938-autonomous-4-wheel-robot-light-tracker-arduino-mega-2560,Simulate and deploy a Run on Target Hardware Arduino algorithm that tracks light and detects bumps.,"<p>A sample model that implements light following and bump detection algorithms on a 4-wheel autonomous vehicle with an Arduino Mega 2560 onboard.  The light following algorithm is based on two light sensors mounted in the front of the vehicle that when a difference is sensed, the vehicle turns towards the brighter side.  Also implemented is that the vehicle drives faster when the light is dim (proxy for ‘far’), and slower when it is bright (proxy for ‘close’).  Bump logic is done with left/right bump sensors, and the vehicle backs up and then turns away from the object it struck.The model is created in a way to allow for simulation and code generation.  Numerous test scenerios are implemented with a Signal Builder block to test aspects of algorithms prior to trying on the final platform.External mode can be toggled to allow for monitoring of signals and tuning of parameters, and the model currently implements the back_time parameter as tunable when an object is struck.The ZIP file includes the listing of hardware used, wiring schematics. It is encouraged to continue to expand on more complicated and robust algorithms, new sensors/actuators, etc.For more information, please refer to:- Simulink Targets: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/simulink-embedded-hardware.html"">http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/simulink-embedded-hardware.html</a>  - Arduino Support from Simulink: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/arduino-simulink.html-"">http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/arduino-simulink.html-</a> Support Package for Arduino Mega: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35641Facecast"">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35641Facecast</a> was on June 7, recorded video can be located here - <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MATLAB/app_142371818162"">http://www.facebook.com/MATLAB/app_142371818162</a> (Arduino Support from Simulink video)</p>","arduino,mega 2560,target hardware",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/751974-dan-lluch,2016-09-01 15:21:20.000000,2016-09-01 15:21:20.000000,2,0,0.0,4,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/36938/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2012, The MathWorks, Inc.

680,36989,Simulink block set for Gtkwave : An alternative of simulink scope.,TAB,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/36989-simulink-block-set-for-gtkwave-an-alternative-of-simulink-scope,Simulink blockset to display the simulation data from simulink on GTKWave,"<p>What is it?-----------------------------GTKWave is a free and open source ""wave analyzer tool"" generally usedin HDL design. It can display integer and real value data.There are lots of color and formating option which make it pleasant touse and also it has many marker and cursor options which makeswaveform analysis simple.It can read VCD and other dump file formates.Simulink blockset for GTKWave can be used to display the simulation datafrom simulink. The scope provided by simulink for waveform display isvery uncomfortable for scrolling, zooming and timing analysis.  This blockset can be used as alternative of the simulink scope.Using this blockset, simulink data can be displayed on Gtkawave tool for easy analysis.How to install?-----------------------------(1) Blockset is created and tested on Windows system. So download the windows    version of GTKWave (available version 3.3.34) from    <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/</a>    Unzip the file in any folder you want(but make sure that, parent directory path    shouldn't contain space. Otherwise tcl script will not run).    The root_folder_of_GTKWave_tool should contain following folders            -- Bin            -- lib            -- share(2) You have below files &amp; folders for GTKWave blockset            -- gtk_ml_supp (folder contains m-file &amp; a c-file)            -- InstallGTKWaveBlockSet.m            -- AutoSigAddn.tcl            -- MenuConfg.gtkwaverc    Copy these folders and files in the root_folder_of_GTKWave_tool.(3) Now open Matlab and set the current directory to ""root_folder_of_GTKWave_tool""    Run the script ""InstallGTKWaveBlockSet.m"".(4) Now set current directory to ""root_folder_of_GTKWave_tool\gtk_ml_supp"".    Enter command    &gt;&gt; mex mexGTKWaveWriteVCD.c    to compile the .c file. It should generate .mex file successfully. Mex file is used for    making the process of VCD file writing fast.(5) Blockset is installed and ready to use. Blockset will now appear on simulink    library browser.(6) Blockset is created and tested for Fixed-step Descrete models on Matlab R2012a.How to use?-----------------------------Blockset contains two blocks    -- GTKLogPort    -- GTKSetupConnect the GTKLogPort to the signals which you want to log and display in the GTKWave.Specify the Name, Data type and Data flow properties.Now drag and connect the GTKSetup block to the ""Root level"" of the model. Set the""Launch output on GTKWave"" property to ""on"". Only one GTKSetup block is required foreach model and should be at root level of model.Now run the simulation. After the simulation, GTKWave will be launced automaticallyand it will display the signals which are logged with GTKLogPort.You can disable the launching of GTKWave after simulation by setting the GTKSetup's""Launch output on GTKWave"" property to ""off"".---------------------------Best of luck.Feel free to contact <a href=""mailto:one.tabrez@gmail.com"">one.tabrez@gmail.com</a> for reporting any issue, any queryor problem.---------------------------</p>","gtkwave,gtkwaveblockset,simulink scope block alternative,vcd",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2299743-tab,2012-09-14 17:07:00.000000,2012-09-14 17:07:00.000000,5,0,0.0,3,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/36989/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2012, TAB

Therefore, you will also need mspdebug (<a href=""http://mspdebug.sourceforge.net/"">http://mspdebug.sourceforge.net/</a>) on Linux todownload/debug after compiling with CCSv5 toolchain.On Linux, you can use mspgcc toolchain instead of CCSv5. This package supportsboth mspgcc and CCSv5 on Linux.Make sure your toolchain is working (build and download some test project, check connection)before you proceed!2) a) Extract this package somewhere. Make sure there are no spaces/non-ascii characters in path (just in case).   b) Make sure you have a working/supported host compiler (<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2012b/index.html"">http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2012b/index.html</a>) by running 'mex -setup' in MATLAB.   c) Within MATLAB, 'cd' to the directory containing launchpad_setup.m and run this script.   d) Swap TX/RX jumpers on TI LaunchPad (see the group of 5 jumpers on your board). This package uses HW UART (see inscription on the board). If you don't do this, Serial Read/Write blocks and PIL will not work.3) You should be good to go.What this package already has:- Standalone execution on target (driven by ISR)- Support for MSP430G2553 only- Simulink library blocks for:        * Serial read/write (hardware UART - you must swap TX/RX jumpers on your LaunchPad)        * LED        * Built-in temperature sensor        * Push button- Execution in PIL mode (hardware UART - you must swap TX/RX jumpers on your LaunchPad)- PIL mode profilingWhat this package would like to have:- More Simulink blocks- Support for other LaunchPad compatible MCUs- More documentation</p>","target support,embedded coder,launchpad,msp430,pil,simulink,target support,texas instruments,ti,texas instruments,launchpad",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2945398-mikhail,2015-08-17 17:59:46.000000,2015-08-17 17:59:46.000000,7,1,5.0,11,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/37825/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2012, Mikhail

The lowpass equivalent is a baseband signal which is converted to IF signal X based on this transformation: X=real(XL)*cos(2*pi*Fc*t)-Imaginary(XL)*sin(2*pi*Fc*t),where Fc is the carrier frequency and is the frequency of sine and cosine generator.for more info about the lowpass equivalent look this book:Digital communications by J.G.Proakis &amp; M.Salehi.(5th edition, McGrawHill 2008)The IF signal is given to a scope to plot the waveform. you have to double click on the scope to view the waveform. The purple one is the IF BPSK signal and the yellow one is the bit stream.The IF signal is also given to a spectrum scope in order to plot its FFT.The Frequency domain shows that the FFT is located aroundthis frequency: Fc*sample_time sample_time is given in sine and cosine generator.</p>","communications,signal processing,simulation,simulink,wireless,signal processing",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2860227-mohsen-farhang,2012-09-12 18:46:39.000000,2012-09-12 18:46:39.000000,0,1,5.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/38121/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2012, Mohsen Farhang

The position of the piston can be seen in the ‘position’ scope, and the pressure in the ‘pressure’ scope.Increasing motor speed     1)Double click on pump subsystem and increase the angular velocity of the pump driving shaft from 10 to 100 rpm.     2)Notice the change in hydraulic pressure and rod position in the scopes.     3)The pressure is limited at 1e5 pascals due to the pressure relief valve.     4)The max position of the rod is 0.05m because Force = Pressure*Area of piston = 100000*5e-4 = 50 N. The displacement of the rod is then determined by x = F/k = 50/1000 = 0.05m. k is the spring constant of the spring attached to the mass.     5)Notice also how the pressure changes when the rod is moving (workdone by the rod)Increasing pressure relief valve setting     1)Change the Valve Pressure setting to 2e5 Pa.      2)Notice now the rod is able to move to 0.1 m. Force = Pressure*PistonArea = 2e5 * 5e-4 = 100N. Displacement of rod = F/K = 100/1000 = 0.1m.Changing Piston Area     1)Change the piston Area from 5e-4 m^2 to 5e-5 m^2 (reducing the area).     2)Notice the max rod displacement is 0.01m. Force = Pressure*PistonArea = 2e5 * 5e-5 = 10N. Displacement of rod = F/K = 10/1000 = 0.01m.Changing spring constant     1)Change the spring constant k (double click mass subsystem) from 1000 to 500 N/m.     2)Notice the rod position increases to from 0.01 to 0.02m. Force = Pressure*PistonArea = 2e5 * 5e-5 = 10N. Displacement of rod = F/K = 10/500 = 0.02m.     3)Change Damping constant from 100 to 10.      4)Notice the transient portion of the rod position vibrates more because of lower damping value.</p>","4 ways valve,4 ways valve,cylinder,damper,double acting hydraulic cylinder,hydraulic,hydraulic pump,hydraulic system,mass,piston,pressure relief valve,pump,reservoir,spring,valve,4 ways valve,cylinder,damper,double acting hydraulic cylinder,hydraulic,hydraulic pump,hydraulic system,mass,piston,pressure relief valve,pump,reservoir,spring,valve,4 ways valve,electric_motor_control,power_electronics_control,4 ways valve,damper",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2346878-james,2012-09-21 19:32:48.000000,2012-09-21 19:32:48.000000,0,0,0.0,5,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/38259/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2012, Chee Syn Ang

The objective is to move a stack of three colored blocks from one location to the next such that the final stack is ordered according to color and size. The ordering is an emerging behavior based on local control for each of the blocks. As such, this is a distributed version of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle which is an example of a cyber-physical system.Stereoscopic vision of a video stream of the virtual world enables the machine to first locate where the stack of blocks is. Feedforward control allows a quick pick and place action. Feedback control is used to move the blocks between locations. A pneumatic airflow is modeled to enable the machine to pick and move the blocks.<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L85uAgMamX8"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L85uAgMamX8</a></p>","academic,cyberphysical system,equation based modeling,equationbased modeling,image processing,industrie 40,industry 40,manufacturing,multiparadigm,multiparadigm modeling,physics,physics modeling,robotics,service oriented architectures,smart systems,software architectures,st,stereopsis,stereoscopic vision,streaming video,towers of hanoi,multiparadigm modeling",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/869405-pieter-mosterman,2018-04-05 21:03:04.000000,2018-04-05 21:03:04.000000,7,6,4.0,5,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/38515/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2012, The MathWorks, Inc.

Includes blocks to read external rad,"<p>As part of developing a new graduate level Guidance, Navigation, and Control course at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a Simulink blockset has been developed that will allow students to work solely in Matlab/Simulink for the development of GNC code. This code can be downloaded directly to the ArduPilot 2.0 integrated sensor and processing package allowing the students to easily develop small unmanned aerial vehicles. The blockset is useful in that it eliminates the requirement to have a knowledgeable programmer, and a knowledgeable electrical engineer to integrate hardware and software with the airframe. The included guide is intended to describe the functionality of the blockset, provide recommendations for how to implement control designs, and steps on how to embed the code onto the ArduPilot directly from Simulink. The blockset is in early development and there is room for improvement; it is expected that future students or the academic community as a whole will advance the capabilities going forward.This blockset uses the new Run-On-Target-Hardware feature that first appeared in Matlab 2012a which allows Simulink users to auto-generate code from a Simulink model for select hardware targets. This feature was previously only available to owners of Simulink Coder and other similar toolboxes.For more information, please see the HowTo document included in the .zip file.

Example drivers for:-) Arduino digital output-) Arduino digital input-) Arduino analog output-) Arduino encoder readare included.While the examples are built using the Arduino as the hardware platform (specifically relying on the Simulink Support Package for Arduino), the method applies to any other supported target.In this guide, the first method to develop device drivers is based on the S-Function Builder block. Following chapters also describe different methods based respectively on the Legacy Code tool, the MATLAB function block, and the System Object block. Advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed in the guide.Finally, note that for MATLAB 2013b you will need to apply a fix for the S-Function builder to develop blocks with no input. To do so, go to the following page: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/1006532"">http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/1006532</a> , scroll down to the bottom, and follow the instructions therein.</p>","pick of the week,potw,dc motor,stepper motor,adafruit,arduino,dc motor,device,driver,embedded,encoder,mark try to copy the content and paste it in a word document mar,motor shield,pick of the week,potw,stepper motor,arduino,arduino,arduino,arduino,encoder,arduino,mark try to copy the content and paste it in a word document mar,driver,arduino",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1692307-giampiero-campa,2016-09-01 15:22:29.000000,2016-09-01 15:22:29.000000,119,55,4.0,91,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/39354/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2012, The MathWorks, Inc.

The Z-source inverter is very advantageous over traditional inverters and it can be employed in all ac and dc power conversion applications. All traditional PWM methods can be used to control Z-source inverter. Maximum constant boost control methods eliminates the low-frequency ripples in the inductor current and capacitor voltage by maintaining the shoot-through duty cycle constant, and minimize the voltage stresses of switching devices at the same time. The Maximum boost control method is suitable for relatively high output frequency only, but in the maximum constant boost control method the Z-source network design is independent of the output frequency and determined only by the switching frequency. In thisSIMULATION Z-source inverter parameters such as boost factor, output dc link voltage, capacitor voltage, output ac voltage, voltage gain etc. are determined for maximum constant boost control method for a fixed modulation index and these results are verified by SIMULATION results.</p>","electric_motor_control,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,communications,control design,measurement,modeling,optimization,signal processing,simulation,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3924235-amit-tiwari,2013-01-15 20:19:22.000000,2013-01-15 20:19:22.000000,10,3,3.0,25,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/39865/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2013, Amit TIWARI

The miniature aerial vehicle (MAV), which is to be retrieved, is regulated to follow the drogue orbit and to approach the drogue with a relatively low airspeed. After the MAV dock on the drogue, the towed cable and bodies (both drogue and MAV) are reeled into the mothership to complete the aerial recovery.In this demo, Gauss’s Principle is used to derive the dynamic model of the cable-drogue system. The MAV uses missile guidance strategies to intercept the drogue.For more information see:Sun, L., Beard, R. W., and Colton, M. B., McLain, T.

Quadrotor model is take,"<p>This file contains the simulink simulation of the PD control of a Quadrotor. Quadrotor model is taken from Dr. Bouabdallah's PhD thesis found also in the file. The PD control is enough to control the quadrotor in disturbance free situations.The “big” Omega I used in my model is actually “Gamma” found in the quadrotor dynamics. The controls can be calculated from the rotors’ speeds, so using the same equations reversely we can find the rotors’ speeds out of the controls (solve for the rotors’ speeds using the upper equations, 4 equations with 4 unknowns). γ is the effect of rotor speeds on the system. In general there are no sensors put on the quadrotor to measure its rotors’ speeds, so we can’t calculate gamma in practical and it is assumed as disturbance. Gamma is calculated using the four rotors’ speeds as:Gamma = omega1 - omega2 + omega3 - omega4 : The resultant effect of all the rotors.What I did is calculating omegasquare of each rotor, used omegasquares to calculate gamma, then recalculate the controls.</p>","pd control,quadrotor control,quadrotor simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1111816-abdel-razzak,2014-04-10 17:27:08.000000,2014-04-10 17:27:08.000000,12,13,5.0,56,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/41149/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2013, Abdel-Razzak

If we can setup add_exec_event_listener for the block2. If we can get the run time object of the block.The tool uses the second method. Because with the first one, the script can't be used more than once in the same session.If used it would highlight all the blocks as it can't add the listed again.Please go through the help &gt;&gt;help add_exec_event_listener.Sample: Unzip the contents and run hilite_virtual_blocks('check_path') in the MATLAB command prompt. Note: 'check_path' is a sample model in the attachment.Please compare the Simulink block sorted order for the same. This gives some idea on how the Simulink engine works.---- Sorted list for 'check_path' [2 nonvirtual blocks, directFeed=0]  0:0    'check_path/Constant' (Constant, tid=-2)  0:1    'check_path/Scope' (Scope, tid=1)Call the function again by changing the optimization settings and find the differences from the previous run.Play it with a larger model. This function potentially can be used for studying model coverage.Constraints:- It will not work across model reference boundaries. Hence it has to be executed for the referenced models manually.- The automation creates unsaved changes, but the changes can be ignored.- Model should be simulatable.Please feel free to improve it and add your comments.</p>","add_exec_event_listener,model optimization,runtimeobject,sorted order,virtual blocks",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1085326-sysenso-systems,2013-07-08 19:56:20.000000,2013-07-08 19:56:20.000000,3,1,5.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/41272/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2013, Neelakanda Bharathiraja

Compare results to see if they match.Task 2: Explore and try a simulation of the robot on the floor with sample target waypoints, change controller parameters to see changes in behavior.  Compare results.Task 3: Run the same algorithm from previous task on the real robot, logging real time histories.  Compare to previous simulation.Task 4: Design and simulate your algorithm for an arbitrary set of waypoints, explore algorithms to find the shortest distance between points.This example uses this Simulink Support Package for LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Hardware:<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/lego-mindstorms-simulink.htmlLearn"">http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/lego-mindstorms-simulink.htmlLearn</a> more about running Simulink models on target hardware here:<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/simulink-embedded-hardware.html"">http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/simulink-embedded-hardware.html</a> </p>","robotics,lego mindstorms,nxt robot,obstacle avoidance,path planning,robot navigation,robotics,student competition",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/4365922-mathworks-robotics-team,2016-09-01 15:25:04.000000,2016-09-01 15:25:04.000000,3,1,5.0,3,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/42835/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2013, The MathWorks, Inc.

For an overview please see:<a href=""http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7e.htmYou"">http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7e.htmYou</a> may use operating systems Windows as well as HP-Unix. ""Preset"" 64 bit windowsdynamic link libraries (mexw64) may be substituted via 32 bit windows (mexw32), orprior version (dll) or HP-UNIX (mexhpux). You may also generate your own dynamic link libraries for other operating systems. This SIMULINK add-on block library Function Chart offers a reasonable tool for realization of event-state-nets, which is close to the German guideline VDI /VDE 3684 ""Description of event-driven motion processes by function charts"" [Beuth publishers Berlin]. You can graphical programme without a special function chart window, without compiler run in case of simulations and without special function chart coder software in case of real-time code generation. The library allows separate motion error handling sequences, separated from normal motion sequences without loss of a well-ordered graphical arrangement. This is also true for transmission of variables from function charts to drives as well as for display of active states.For a summary of essential features please see:    <a href=""http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_2e.htmFirst"">http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_2e.htmFirst</a> of all please scrutinize examples in directory ""BeiV32_TBBS"" necessarily.Programming special projects please pay attention to correct use of syntax:            <a href=""http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_6e.htm#PM2"">http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_6e.htm#PM2</a> and parametrization:   <a href=""http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_6e.htm#PM1.This"">http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_6e.htm#PM1.This</a> applies especially to the input of same Function Chart numbers (FN) but different state numbers (BN) for all state blocks, such as blocks ZA, ZX, ZE and ZF, within &gt;&gt;&gt;one&lt;&lt;&lt; Function Chart. Please note several Function Charts may be definedinside of one project. For examples please see:    <a href=""http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_5e.htmFor"">http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_5e.htmFor</a> a summary of application hints please see:    <a href=""http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_4e.htmBlock"">http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_4e.htmBlock</a> helps are available at:    <a href=""http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_3e.htmSupplementary"">http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_3e.htmSupplementary</a> toolbox ""Function Chart Check"" is available in directory ""SyntaxV31""for check of syntax, FN (Function Chart number) and BN (state number), use of variables, use of selected blocks, potential dead ends or right construction of loops. Addition of the corresponding directory ""SyntaxV31"" to MATLAB search path and following call of ""FupCheck""at MATLAB prompt opens a GUI window with several check buttons. Alternatively to these GUI windows 4 script files with same functionality are available [TEST_PARA (parameter check), TEST_SACK (dead end check), TEST_SYNT (syntax check), TEST_WEIT (loop check)]. These four script files correspond to four GUI sub windows of FupCheck. Directory ""BeiV31_TBFe"" contains some examples with designed errors within function charts in order to get familiar with this test toolbox. For more detailed explanations please see:    <a href=""http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_6e.htmAttention"">http://eeiwzg.et.tu-dresden.de/ae2_files/ae_7_6e.htmAttention</a> should be paid to some essential preconditions given there and importent for theapplication of this check tools.Please also note: Version 3.2 supplementary toolbox ""Function Chart Check"" may be applied only to mdl-files, but not to slx-files.Directory ""QuellenV32"" provides with source files for dynamic link libraries in order to enable generation of dynamic link libraries for other operating systems,such as LINUX, or for generation of real time code assuming availability of anyC compiler for target hardware.Preliminary remark before use - dear potential user,originally this ZIP file would contain a ready for use FunctionChart block library,but &gt;&gt;&gt;THIS&lt;&lt;&lt; ZIP file version doesn't contain any dynamic link library, i.e. neithermexw64 nor mexw32, dll or mexhpux. Reason may be learnt from following e-mailafter having prepared a first submission of this Simulink add-on block library:-----------------------------------------------... thank you for participating in the MATLAB Central Community.  I have reviewed your submission to File Exchange and noticed it contains .DLL and .MEX files. Since it's important for others to be able to inspect and learn from your code, we do not publish any executable files (EXE, DLL, P- code, MEX, etc.).  Please consider resubmitting your contribution without the .DLL and .MEX files.... MATLAB Central Administrator, MathWorks -----------------------------------------------Thus you cannot directly download and test.  Please look at “ReadMe_DynamicLinkLibraries_MCFE.txt” for workarounds.Sorry for needless effort, but according e-mail above such intermediate step isn't avoidable.</p>","dead end,electric drive,eventdriven,gui,modeling,motion control,realtime code,simulation,simulink,state,syntax",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/20430-gert-helge-geitner,2013-07-29 14:55:13.000000,2013-07-29 14:55:13.000000,0,0,0.0,2,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/42875/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2013, Gert-Helge Geitner

A case study.  ,"<p>Developed between 2006 - 2008 by Justyna Zander and Abel Marrero Perez at Fraunhofer Institute FOKUS, Berlin, Germany. Supervised by Ina Schieferdecker.The main contribution of this thesis applies to the software built into embedded systems. In particular, it refers to the software models from which systems are built. An approach to functional black-box testing based on the system models by providing a test model is developed. It is contrasted with the currently applied test methods that form dedicated solutions, usually specialized in a concrete testing context. The test framework proposed herewith, is realized in the MATLAB®/Simulink®/Stateflow® environment and is called Model-in-the-Loop for Embedded System Test (MiLEST).The developed signal-feature - oriented paradigm allows the abstract description of signals and their properties. It addresses the problem of missing reference signal flows as well as the issue of systematic test data selection. Numerous signal features are identified. Furthermore, predefined test patterns help build hierarchical test specifications, which enables a construction of the test specification along modular divide-and-conquer principles. The processing of both discrete and continuous signals is possible, so that the hybrid behavior of embedded systems can be addressed. The testing with MiLEST starts in the requirements phase and goes down to the test execution level. The essential steps in this test process are automated, such as the test data generation and test evaluation to name the most important.Three case studies based on adaptive cruise control are presented. These examples correspond to component, component-in-the-loop, and integration level tests. Moreover, the quality of the test specification process, the test model, and the resulting test cases is investigated in depth. The resulting test quality metrics are applied during the test design and test execution phases so as to assess whether and how the proposed method is more effective than established techniques.Available on GitHub: <a href=""https://github.com/justynazander/MiLEST"">https://github.com/justynazander/MiLEST</a></p>","embedded system,milest,model based testing,model in the loop,simulink based testing,speed control,test,test harness,verification",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2792929-justyna-zander,2013-11-15 21:48:26.000000,2013-11-15 21:48:26.000000,0,0,0.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/44327/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2013, Justyna Zander

This achieves a substantial reduction in the magnitude and variation of the switching frequency, thus improving efficiency, while retaining all of the advantages identified with hysteresis current control. LCL filters have good performances in current ripple attenuations, but they introduce a resonance frequency in the system. The operation and control of the inverter are described, together with simulation and experimental results. The proposed controller has been verified in simulation using the Simulink package in Matlab. An analysis and design procedure of output LCL-filter for single-phase grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) inverter system is presented in this paper. A comparison between the designed LCL-filter and L-filter based single-phase grid-connected PV inverter system is carried out. The comparison results are given to validate the theoretical analysis and effectiveness of filters.</p>","grid connected inverter,hysteresis controllerpv invertercurrent control,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3050962-khairy,2013-12-05 17:59:38.000000,2013-12-05 17:59:38.000000,4,8,3.0,28,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/44612/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2013, Khairy

Beyond the detrimental impacts to human health the EPA points out that, ozone, which can be created by car emissions, “is also responsible for several billion dollars of agricultural crop yield loss in the U.S. each year.”  In order to potentially save millions of lives and save billions of dollars our team has endeavored to apply process control techniques to help solve the problem of excess air pollution during cold starts of an automobile. When a car starts “cold”, or at ambient temperature, it takes a while for the catalytic converter to reach its light-off temperature, the temperature at which the pollutants in the exhaust react significantly to form less harmful substances. During catalytic warm up, toxic pollutants exit with the exhaust at high rates. Our team proposes using a heating element to heat the catalytic converter up faster so that less deadly pollutants enter the atmosphere.Experimental MethodsTheory We modeled the catalytic converter dynamics using Simulink and a MatLab S-Function. In designing the model, we made several simplifying assumptions. First, we assumed that the catalytic converter could be modeled as a CSTR, which allowed us to treat the temperature of the converter as uniform rather than accounting for temperature change along its length. We also simplified the reaction term by assuming that the reaction was first order and that the only reaction was the conversion of carbon monoxide, the dominant pollutant, to carbon dioxide in the presence of a platinum catalyst. Conduction between the catalyst particles and the converter body was assumed to be fast such that the temperature of the catalyst and converter body would be equivalent. Heat conduction to other parts of the car from the catalytic converter was ignored, and we assumed that the total heat transfer in the catalytic converter could be modeled using approximate overall heat transfer coefficients, UAinside and UAoutside. Finally, we assumed that the electrical power being sent to the converter was converted completely into a heat source, Q. With these simplifications, we determined transient energy and species balances that describe the changes in catalytic converter temperature, TC, concentration of CO in the exiting exhaust, CCO, and exiting exhaust temperature T¬E. The balances are shown in Equations 1, 2, and 3, where q is the exhaust flow rate and V is the volume of the catalytic converter.(∂T_C)/∂t=1/mCp[UA_inside (T_E-T_C )+UA_outside (T_A-T_C )+Q](1)(∂C_CO)/∂t=q/V (C_(CO,0)-C_CO )-k_0 e^(-E_a/(RT_C )) C_CO(2)(∂T_E)/∂t=1/(ρCp_CO V)[UA_inside (T_C-T_E )+ΔH_rxn k_0 〖e^(-E_a/(RT_C )) C〗_CO V+ρCp_CO q(T_F-T_E)](3)We put these balances into an S-Function in Simulink to solve the differential equations. Using the Simulink model, we then did a doublet test to determine guess values for PI controller constants, which we then tuned to best follow set point changes.</p>","active heating,catalytic converter,pollution,transient reactor,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2999766-john-hedengren,2013-12-11 22:26:40.000000,2013-12-11 22:26:40.000000,4,3,5.0,4,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/44677/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2013, John Hedengren

We developed a dynamic nonlinear model based on the prosthetic apparatus as shown in the Figure.  The spring constant of the prosthetic was optimized in order to achieve the highest overall efficiency of the leg.  Overall efficiency was determined by comparing the mechanical efficiency to the distance efficiency.  Mechanical efficiency was defined as the energy output over the work required to move the leg and the distance efficiency was defined as the distance our prosthetic moved over the desired distance of movement.  The model was successfully optimized with a spring constant value of 1.94 N/m. Method/ProcedureIn order to optimize the spring constant in our prosthetic leg, we began by creating a dynamic nonlinear model.  This involved determining mathematical relationships between body velocity and the force on our knee, which acted on the spring system inside our prosthetic.  This was then mathematically related to the knee’s torque and angular velocity, which resulted in a model of the prosthetic leg’s motion.  This model was entered into Simulink in which the overall velocity of our body became the input and the movement of our leg became the output.Within this dynamic model, one important factor was the spring constant (k) inside the prosthetic knee.  Our focus in this lab was to optimize the k value in a way that would maximize both the accuracy of each step and the mechanical efficiency of the prosthetic.  We simulated our model across a range of k values and compared the resulting distance efficiencies and mechanical efficiencies.  After determining our optimal k, we used this in our simulation to check its accuracy.</p>","efficiency,prosthetic,spring constant",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2999766-john-hedengren,2013-12-12 15:10:41.000000,2013-12-12 15:10:41.000000,0,1,5.0,8,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/44679/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2013, John Hedengren

Controllers included!,"<p>These files allow the simulation of a differential steered (unicycle-like) mobile robot considering its complete dynamic model. The dynamic model here adopted is based on velocities (not torques), which makes it easier to integrate with existing mobile robot controllers that generate references for linear and angular velocities. Although not required, the blocks were built to be compatible with Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox, so the user can make use of the toolbox functions.Sets of dynamic parameters are available for the following robots:- Pioneer 3-DX with Sick LASER sensor; - Pioneer 3-DX without LASER sensor; - Pioneer 2 without on-board computer (no LASER sensor); - Pioneer 2 with on-board computer (no LASER sensor); - Robotic wheelchair carrying a 55kg person; - Robotic wheelchair carrying a 125kg person; - Khepera III (LAUT, 2011); - RobuLAB-10 (SHOJAEI et al., 2011).The files include two libraries:- ""DiffSteer_model.slx"": contains the kinematic and dynamic blocks of the differential-drive mobile robot.- ""Controllers.slx"": contains the following blocks: a) trajectory tracking kinematic controller; b) dynamic compensation controller 1; c) dynamic compensation controller 2; d) dynamic parameters estimator (for adaptive controllers); e) trajectory generator; f) performance calculator (IAE, ITAE, ISE, ITSE and energy indexes). Four Simulink systems are provided as examples:1. ""kinematic_controller_system.slx"": implements a simple trajectory tracking controller using both kinematic and dynamic blocks of the robot.2. ""dynamic_controller_system.slx"": implements a more complex system that includes an adaptive dynamic compensation controller and the trajectory tracking controller with noisy sensor measurements.Note: After running ""kinematic_controller_system.slx"" or ""dynamic_controller_system.slx"" simulations you can check the results running the included script ""plot_results.m"".3. ""sl_lanechange_unicycle.slx"": implements the same system as the Robotics Toolbox ""sl_lanechange"", but using the kinematic model of the differential steered mobile robot.4. ""sl_lanechange_unicycle_dynamics.slx"": implements the same system as the Robotics Toolbox ""sl_lanechange"", but using the kinematic and the dynamic models of the differential steered mobile robot.Also, the following scripts are provided:1. ""sim_kin_controller.m"": uses the ""kinematic_controller_system.slx"" system to simulate a kinematic trajectory tracking controller acting on a mobile robot (complete model).2. ""sim_dyn_controller.m"": uses the ""dynamic_controller_system.slx"" system to simulate an adaptive dynamic compensation controller operating with the trajectory tracking controller acting on a mobile robot (complete model).3. ""plot_results.m"" and ""plot_results_kin.m"": present the results of the simulations.All blocks were tested in MATLAB R2012b, R2013a, R2014b, R2016a and 2017a, all under Windows.Enjoy!If you use this toolbox, please cite the following paper:MARTINS, F.

1064,45890,Adaptive DPD Design,Kerry Schutz,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45890-adaptive-dpd-design,A workflow for modeling and simulating PAs and adaptive DPDs.,"<p>See the README.PDF for an explanation of the contents of this zip file and how to use the models. See DPD.PDF for general background on PA and DPD modeling.Digital pre-distortion (DPD) is a baseband signal processing technique that corrects for impairments inherent to RF power amplifiers (PAs). These impairments cause out-of-band emissions or spectral regrowth and in-band distortion which correlates with an increased bit-error-rate (BER). Wideband signals with a high peak-to-average ratio, as is characteristic of LTE/4G transmitters, are particulary susceptible to these unwanted effects. In this paper, we illustrate a workflow for modeling and simulating  PAs and DPDs.  The models shown in this article are based on two technical papers, [1] and [2]. We start from PA measurements. From measurements, we derive a static DPD design based on a memory polynomial. Such a polynomial corrects for both the non-linearities and memory effects in the PA. For simulation purposes, we construct a system-level  model to evaluate the DPD’s effectiveness. Because any PAs characteristics will vary over time and operating conditions, we extend the static DPD design to an adaptive one. We evaluate two adaptive DPD designs, one based on the (Least-Mean Square) LMS algorithm and a second using the Recurive Predictor Error Method (RPEM) algorithm.</p>","digital predistortionpapower amplifierspectral regrowthrecursive,dpd",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/721848-kerry-schutz,2014-08-01 20:33:40.000000,2014-08-01 20:33:40.000000,12,5,4.0,29,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/45890/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2014, Kerry Schutz

First, the Trajectory_Planner file is run that creates the desired trajectories of the Swing Foot Heel (position, velocity and acceleration) in Cartesian as well as joint space. The CTC needs the Qdot and Qdotdot information as its input.The desired trajectories are created using piecewise cubic splines (based on initial, intersection and final conditions). It also looks at the Cartesian to joint transformation (The J matrix) to ensure that it is well-posed; i.e within the working envelope. Afterwards, run the Simulink model that has all the function blocks including a Forward Kinematics block that gets the Cartesian position by using joint information.There is also a file to display the results in an animation. It uses the joint information (from Simulink results) and performs forward kinematics to get all positions and draws it.NOTE - ALL THE SIMULATION DATA IS FOR ONE SECOND ONLY AND THE FOOT IMPACT IS NOT MODELLED. HOWEVER, IT CAN BE DONE BY CONSIDERING PRE-IMPACT AND POST-IMPACT CONDITIONS AND CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM.For a full compass gait model; check this:<a href=""http://www.birl.ethz.ch/education/BIMC2012/uploads/compass_gait_mwe.m"">http://www.birl.ethz.ch/education/BIMC2012/uploads/compass_gait_mwe.m</a></p>","bipedal robot,compass gait,computer torque control,ctc,cubic spline,robotics,spline,trajectory planning,walking",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/5153190-ali,2014-03-21 19:57:09.000000,2014-03-21 19:57:09.000000,1,2,4.0,4,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/45979/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2014, Ali

Beginning with the switch open (in the ""off"" position), the current in the circuit is 0. When the switch is first closed, the current will begin to increase, and the inductor will produce an opposing voltage across its terminals in response to the changing current. This voltage drop counteracts the voltage of the source and therefore reduces the net voltage across the load. Over time, the rate of change of current decreases, and the voltage across the inductor also then decreases, increasing the voltage at the load. During this time, the inductor is storing energy in the form of a magnetic field. If the switch is opened while the current is still changing, then there will always be a voltage drop across the inductor, so the net voltage at the load will always be less than the input voltage source. When the switch is opened again, the voltage source will be removed from the circuit, and the current will decrease. The changing current will produce a change in voltage across the inductor, now aiding the source voltage. The stored energy in the inductor's magnetic field supports current flow through the load. During this time, the inductor is discharging its stored energy into the rest of the circuit. If the switch is closed again before the inductor fully discharges, the voltage at the load will always be greater than zero.</p>","buck converter,choppers",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/5303646-b-nagi-reddy,2014-05-05 19:26:25.000000,2014-05-05 19:26:25.000000,0,1,5.0,2,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/46462/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2014, B NAGI REDDY

1128,46897,Emergency power system for a more electrical aircraft,Pierre Mercier,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46897-emergency-power-system-for-a-more-electrical-aircraft,Simulation of a power system in an aircraft using three products in the Physical Modelling,"<p>This demo presents a model of simulation of a RAT (Ram Air Turbine) system used as emergency power system in an aircraft. Electrical, mechanical and hydraulic components are modeled respectively with SimPowerSystems, SimHydraulics and SimMechanics. The advantage of a model spanning different physical domains is to have on overview of basic interactions between all the major components. It is most useful in the early stage of the design of a future system, in this case an hybrid emergency system for the more electrical aircraft. The power system is composed from a wind turbine (15 kW) connected to an electrical synchronous generator. The shaft of the turbine is also connected to a pump that supplies a hydraulic circuit linked through a servo valve to a cylinder. The motion of the rod is transformed into rotational movement on the axis of the Aileron. A position controller is used so that the deflection angle tracks a given reference by controlling the servo valve.

This  presents an educational platform based on LEGO© NXT to assist the learning of fuzzy logic control principles at undergraduate level by providing a simple and easy-to-follow teaching setup. The proposed fuzzy control study aims to accompany students to the learning of fuzzy control fundamentals by building hands-on robotic experiments. The proposed educational platform has been successfully applied to several undergraduate courses within the Electronics Department in the University of Guadalajara. The description of robotic experiments and the evaluation of their impact in the student performance are both provided in the paper.The article was published in:International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education,Volume 50, Number 2 (April 2013), Manchester University Press, pp. 157-171.(<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3602)MATLAB"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3602)MATLAB</a> SOFTWAREThe software contains a main simulink file PathtrackingReducido.mdl, seven trajectories functions (tra1.m-tra7.m) and one fuzzy control function controlf2.m Decompress the file fuzzyRobot.zip and first run a trajectory, then run the PathtrackingReducido.mdl PathtrackingReducido.mdl implements a differential robot´s fuzzy path-tracking example. </p>","matlab,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2645360-daniel,2014-06-16 22:09:46.000000,2014-06-16 22:09:46.000000,0,0,0.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/46953/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2014, Daniel

It uses a nonlinear model of a binary distillation column implemented in Simulink. The nonlinear model has four manipulated variables, four controlled variables and three input measured disturbances, plus 41 molar fractions corresponding to every column stage. The methodology for PCA-based MSPC is implemented in two phases. During Phase I, the user can simulate the distillation column under normal operating conditions at three different operating points. When the simulation is finished, the GUI obtains the corresponding PCA model automatically. In Phase II, the user can simulate several scenarios with different combinations of disturbances and failures and monitorize them through Squared Prediction Error (SPE) and T2 control charts. Contribution plots are used in conjunction with these control charts to check the original variables responsible of such abnormal situations.The application allows starting a new benchmark from scratch or opening a previously saved one. User can save its progress at any time as well as export simulation results to an Excel file. Each sheet in this Excel file corresponds to a test in the benchmark. If Excel is not present, the software will attempt to write file in CSV format.This work is part of a Master Thesis available at <a href=""http://mseg.webs.upv.es/App%20Data/VillalbaT.pdf"">http://mseg.webs.upv.es/App%20Data/VillalbaT.pdf</a>.

1143,47211,Programming Rapiro Robot using Simulink,MathWorks Robotics Team,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47211-programming-rapiro-robot-using-simulink,Simulink models for talking to Arduino and Raspberry Pi inside Rapiro,"<p>Background on Rapiro:Rapiro is a humanoid robot. Rapiro comes with 12 servo motors one for its neck, one in the waist, four for the legs, and the final six for its two arms. It also has a servo motor controller board that is Arduino compatible.  We can program the Arduino and control the motor movements using Simulink. It acts as the spine or the nerve center for the Rapiro.Rapiro uses the Arduino uno board. It has a processor atmega 328P. However the Arduino uno that Simulink supports should use atmega 328.  The Simulink Arduino Servo write/Read library block accepts pin numbers from 0 to 13(This is not the microcontroller pin number, it is the digital pin number you see on the Arduino board).  In the RAPIRO arduino, Pin numbers 14, 15 and 16 are used for Servo functionality which are actually mapped as analog Inputs and pin 17 should be high if we have to send power to the motors. These pins have no direct mapping to the Simulink read/write blocks.  So to use those pins please follow the instructions:Place the ServoPinMapping.mat file in the same folder where RAPIRO Simulink model is placed. This mat file contains MATLAB workspace variables A0, A1 ,A2,A3 initialised to 14, 15 ,16 and 17 respectively.Open the Simulink model and go to file -&gt; Model Properties -&gt;Callbacks -&gt;Add “load(‘ServoPinMapping.mat’)” in preload function. This will load the mat file in the Matlab workspace. Now you will be able to use pins numbers 14 through 17 in Simulink. We can use the raspberry pi to act as its brain and the camera to act as its eye. From MATLAB R2014a release we have introduced MATLAB Support Package for Raspberry Pi hardware that provides a command line interface to capture images from the camera.  However there is no direct support to use Simulink support package for raspberry pi camera. But there is a very simple workaround to get the Simulink block set to recognize raspberry pi camera. The latest release of the Raspbian Wheezy image has V4L2 drivers for the Camera Board. This means that you can use the V4L2 Video Capture block in the Simulink block library for Raspberry Pi to capture images from the Raspberry Pi Camera Board.   Please watch the following webinar to see how to go about configuring the raspberry pi camera. <a href=""http://www.element14.com/community/videos/12408/l/how-to-program-a-rapiro-with-simulinkThe"">http://www.element14.com/community/videos/12408/l/how-to-program-a-rapiro-with-simulinkThe</a> models that are attached will show you how to use the raspberry pi to detect the green object and to make the Rapiro walk using Arduino.Simulink Model: RapiroWalkDescription: This model is to make the Rapiro walk and is deployed on the Arduino. It consists of two major blocks called Legs and Leg_Motors. The Legs block provides the input required for the walking motion. The Leg_Motors block consists of servo write blocks that is used to control the speed and rotation of the 4 servo motors.  Required MathWorks products: MATLAB and Simulink release R2014a, or later. Simulink support package for Arduino hardware.Simulink Model: RapiroGreenBallDescription: This model is to demonstrate the use of Raspberry pi camera to detect a green object in the background. This model is deployed on the raspberry pi.  It consists of a video capture block that captures an RGB video. The colorThresholding block to recognize a green object in the background. The block analysis block to detect the presence of blobs i.e. presence of a green object. The draw rectangles block to draw a rectangular bounding box around the detect blob and the video display block to display the RGB video as well as the bounding box on the screenRequired MathWorks products: MATLAB and Simulink release R2014a, or later. Computer Vision System Toolbox. Simulink support package for Raspberry Pi hardware.The next two models are to make the Arduino and Raspberry Pi communicate with each otherSimulink Model: RapiroRaspFinalDescription: This model is deployed on the Raspberry Pi.  To the green ball detection model we add one more block called the GPIO write.  As soon as a blob is detected we send a logical value of 1 to the GPIO pin. This pin is connected to the pin 3 of the ArduinoRequired MathWorks products: MATLAB and Simulink release R2014a, or later. Computer Vision System Toolbox. Simulink support package for Arduino and Raspberry Pi hardwareSimulink Model: RapiroArduinoDescription: This model is deployed onto the Arduino. It consists of a digital input block and is set to pin number 3. This pin of Arduino is physically connected to the GPIO pin of raspberry pi. As soon as the pin turns high a signal is sent to the Arduino which in turn sends commands to motors and thus making the rapiro walk. . As soon as the green ball is taken away from the line of sight of the raspberry pi camera the GPIO pin stops sending data to the Arduino and rapiro stops walking.

Herber,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47317-solving-optimal-control-problems-using-simscape-models-for-state-derivatives,This code replicates the results found in a tech report by the same name,"<p>Here I demonstrate an approach to calculate derivative functions for Simscape models and use them to solve optimal control problems. Although this approach is less efficient than analytic expression for the derivatives, not every problem will have these directly available due to a variety of reasons, including multidomain, multibody, large-scale, automatically generated, or proprietary models.A step-by-step procedure is presented to assist utilizing this approach. The canonical Bryson-Denham state-constrained double integrator optimal control problem is used as a test optimal control problem. A number of control formulations are compared to demonstrate the computational expense of this approach compared to analytic expressions of the state derivatives and additional benefits including improved final solutions and execution time over more traditional formulations. In particular, direct transcription solutions are decidedly more efficient than the common shooting approach.The code is complementary material for the following publication:Daniel R. Herber.

The resulting control scheme is of Disturbance Dual Feed-Forward (DDFF) type. The solution is of model-free type, i.e. no accompanying neural network is needed to model dynamics of the plant. Please see inside the m-files for more information. This submission enables you to play with different system configurations, i.e. several flags are provided to easily reconfigure the system. The solution was inspired by the concept of iterative learning control (ILC). This project might be of your interest if you deal with: repetitive process control, iterative learning control, dynamic optimization problems, and neurocontrollers in the form of online trained neural networks. Such control tasks are often encountered in robotics and power electronics. Refs to relevant papers are included. If something brought you here, it could be probably also interesting to have a look at my gradient-free swarm-based repetitive controller (PDPSRC or PDMSRC on Matlab Central).

A spur gear is attached to the drive shaft, which meshes with a larger gear on the driven shaft. Also attached to the driven shaft is a fan.There are many ways to modify the model parameters:(1) The recommended approach is to open the Model Explorer, navigate to the Model Workspace of the given file, and edit the MATLAB Code provided. Parameters include part dimensions, input angular velocity, colors, and opacity.(2) You can also edit parameters directly through the subsystem masks by clicking on a part in the model. However, be aware that some parameters are used in more than one place (e.g. motor box length is used to compute the y-offset in the Rigid Transform block), hence why I set parameters via MATLAB Code in the Model Workspace.</p>","electric_motor_control,power_electronics_control,gears,motors,multibody simulation,shafts,simmechanics,simple machines,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3529521-matthew-eicholtz,2014-10-06 02:01:04.000000,2014-10-06 02:01:04.000000,2,3,5.0,6,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/48029/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2014, Matt Eicholtz

The model of electrochemical cell has been created on the basis of the characteristics of Li-ion battery determined experimentally.  The Winston Battery Cell LYP40AHA has been used in the study.  Battery model has been developed to reflect the battery voltage during discharge at various condition. Voltage characteristics take into account the change in battery voltage caused by state of charge, temperature and current. The model is dynamic, i.e. it reflects the transient state of battery output voltage. More details on battery model is presented in <a href=""http://www.pe.org.pl/articles/2014/7/3.pdf.Performed"">http://www.pe.org.pl/articles/2014/7/3.pdf.Performed</a> studies allow to presume that the battery model adequately reflects the LiFePO4 behaviour in the ranges of:- temperature 0C - 40°C- cell voltage 2.5V - 3.6V- C-rate current 0-2CThe parameterisation of the model allows to specify a battery pack with a defined cell capacity  and number of cells in series.There is not possible to model pure variable resistors in PLECS, so a capacitive coupled variable resistor with very small capacitance has been used to model a series resistance.

The PWM frequency is set to 5 kHz and duty cycle varies between 0.1 and 0.8. With this 5 kHz PWM frequency, the sample time that would be required to get a 0.5 % resolution on duty cycle using a standard discretization method would be 1e-6 sec:          1 MHz sampling frequency = 200 x 5000 Hz  -&gt; resolution = 1/200 = 0.5 %In the solver tab of the powergui block the simulation type is set to Discrete, and the interpolation option is checked. The Simulation Data Inspector is enabled and the Vload signal is logged. The sample time has been initialized to 20e-6 s in the model properties.1) First perform a simulation with the interpolation in service, with Ts set to 20e-6. 2) In the powergui, uncheck the interpolation and specify Ts=1e-6 in the MATLAB command window. Perform a second simulation.3) In the powergui set the simulation type to Continuous and select Use of Ideal switching devices. Perform a third simulation.4) Open the Data inspector and compare the three simulation runs for the Vload signal. The voltage obtained during first two runs (interpolation with Ts=20e-6 s,  and no interpolation with Ts=1e-6 sec) should be close the continuous simulation result.5) Zoom on the signals and observe that the result obtained with the interpolation solver perfectly matches the result obtained with the continuous solver, and is even more accurate than the standard discrete solver.6) Compare simulation speeds of discrete models (interpolation with Ts=20e-6 sec and no interpolation with Ts=1e-6 sec).  Increase simulation stop time to 0.5 sec.  Run the simulations. The simulation time is displayed at the end of each simulation run in the Diagnostic Viewer. The speed increase obtained with the interpolation method is approximately 4X.About the interpolation option of the powergui block:---------------------------------------------------------------------Select this option to increase simulation speed by enabling the solver to interpolate in discrete models using power electronics. When this option is selected the solver captures gate transitions of power electronic devices occurring between two sample times, thus allowing larger sample times (typically 20X) than you would normally use with the standard solvers.  For example, simulating a 5 kHz PWM converter with Tustin (no interpolation) or Tustin/Backward Euler would normally require a 1.0 usec sample time (sampling frequency = 200 x  PWM frequency) in order to obtain a good resolution on pulse generation and guarantee accurate results.  With the interpolation enabled, using a sample time as large as 20 usec will execute faster while preserving model accuracy. When you enable this option:Use a continuous pulse generator in order guarantee best accuracy on pulse generation (specify sample time = 0 in the pulse generator blocks). In Simulink Model Configuration Parameters select a continuous, variable step solver (ode45 or ode23tb with default settings). The continuous solver is required by the interpolation solver to compute the gate signals time delays with respect to discrete sample times. These pulse delays are used by the solver to interpolate between sample times and produce accurate results.</p>","accuracy,dcdcconverter,interpolation,powergui,pwm,sampletime,electric_motor_control,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/27135-patrice-brunelle,2014-11-07 18:54:36.000000,2014-11-07 18:54:36.000000,2,1,5.0,4,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/48381/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2014, Patrice Brunelle

1251,48921,Linitial Inrush Current,shayan raei,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48921-linitial-inrush-current,Inrush Current At Power Transfomer,"<p>When a transfomer is first energized, a transient current up to 10 to 15 times larger than the rated transformer current can flow for several cycles. Toroidal transformers, using less copper for the same power handling, can have up to 60 times inrush to running current. Worst case inrush happens when the primary winding is connected at an instant around the zero-crossing of the primary voltage, (which for a pure inductance would be the current maximum in the AC cycle) and if the polarity of the voltage half cycle has the same polarity as the remnance in the iron core has. (The magnetic remanence was left high from a preceding half cycle). Unless the windings and core are sized to normally never exceed 50% of saturation, (and in an efficient transformer they never are, such a construction would be overly heavy and inefficient) then during such a start up the core will be saturated. This can also be expressed as the remnant magnetism in normal operation is nearly as high as the saturation magnetism at the ""knee"" of the hysteresis loop. Once the core saturates however, the winding inductance appears greatly reduced, and only the resistance of the primary side windings and the impedance of the power line are limiting the current. As saturation occurs for part half cycles only, harmonic rich waveforms can be generated, and can cause problems to other equipment.For large transformers with low winding resistance and high inductance, these inrush currents can last for several seconds until the transient has died away (decay time proportional to ~XL/R)and the regular AC equilibrium is established. To avoid magnetic inrush, only for transformers with an air gap in the core, the inductive load needs to be synchronously connected near a supply voltage peak, in contrast with the zero voltage switching which is desirable to minimize sharp edged current transients with resistive loads such as high power heaters. But for toroidal transformers only a premagnetising procedure before switching on allows to start those transformers without any inrush current peak.</p>","inrush_current,simulation,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/5969174-shayan-raei,2015-01-01 16:17:19.000000,2015-01-01 16:17:19.000000,0,1,2.0,9,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/48921/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2015, shayan raei

However, for some optimization techniques it is possible to distribute relevant calculations in time. This submission demonstrates that the previously developed plug-in direct particle swarm (or multi-swarm) repetitive controller (PDPSRC or PDMSRC) can be implemented in an industrial microcontroller such as TMS320F2812 assuming only 64K words of external memory (as in TMS320F2812 eZdsp Starter Kit (DSK) -- socketed version). You do not need this starter kit nor a physical converter to run the code. The C-code is included as an S-Function and the PLECS Viewer (available free of charge at <a href=""http://www.plexim.com"">www.plexim.com</a>) is employed to model the plant. Please remember to compile it, i.e. prior to running the model go to S-Function block and click Build. This code has been successfully executed on the above-mentioned DSC for 10 kHz sampling period. No code optimization, such as list based evolutionary optimization, is necessary -- standard rand() is used. Computational burden of the algorithm does not grow with increasing number of subswarms. Here the 10-swarm control algorithm is presented.

Hence, the same idea has been tested also in the B-spline based repetitive neurocontroller proposed in [*]. To be clear, I haven't invented the controller introduced in this model. I've just modified the robustification mechanism used in [*]. You can play here with both mechanisms and decide for yourself which one of them is more suitable for your application.

1297,49897,Signature Tool,McSCert,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49897-signature-tool,The Signature Tool extracts the interface of a Simulink subsystem.,"<p>The notion of subsystem is used in Simulink to represent systems inside systems in order to provide hierarchical modeling. A Simulink subsystem has inports (explicit links to the subsystem), and outports (explicit links from the subsystem). We view inports and outports as the explicit interface of the subsystem. However, there are hidden (implicit) data dependencies in Simulink’s subsystems. Hidden dependencies originate due to two Simulink data mechanisms: Data Store Memory/Read/Write and Goto/From blocks. The Signature Tool extracts the signature of a Simulink subsystem. A signature represents the interface of a Simulink subsystem, making the data flow into and out of the subsystem explicit. The tool identifies two useful signatures for a subsystem: strong signature and weak signature. The strong signature identifies the data mechanisms that are accessed by the subsystem or any of its children. The weak signature identifies the data mechanisms that a subsystem can access (those which are declared higher up in the hierarchy), but is not necessarily using. The Signature Tool can be used to either explicitly include the signatures in the model itself, or export the signatures into a text/tex/docx file. For instructions on installation and how to use the tool, see Signature_UserGuide.pdf in the source files.For more about the theoretical background on signatures and how they can be used, an interested reader is referred to: Marc Bender, Karen Laurin, Mark Lawford, Vera Pantelic, Alexandre Korobkine, Jeff Ong, Bennett Mackenzie, Monika Bialy, Steven Postma, “Signature required: Making Simulink data flow and interfaces explicit,” Science of Computer Programming, Elsevier, 2015, 113, Part 1, 29-50.For more about the capabilities of the tool and how it can be used in model-based development with Simulink, see the two papers:Vera Pantelic, Steven Postma, Mark Lawford, Alexandre Korobkine, Bennett Mackenzie, Jeff Ong, Marc Bender, ""A Toolset for Simulink: Improving Software Engineering Practices in Development with Simulink,"" Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development (MODELSWARD 2015), SCITEPRESS, 2015, 50-61.

The quadrotor is designed in Solidworks with all the mass and inertial properties are defined there, then was exported to XML file to be read by SimMechanics. After some tuning of couple of nested PID loops, using a linearized model of the quadrotor and PID tuning tools in MATLAB, the quadrotor was able to follow some real-time trajectories smoothly. This, then, was lumped in one block, so it can represent an independently controlled quadrotor, with reference inputs (X/Y/Altitude global positions and Yaw) that to be followed, and some outputs for further analysis. This block can be copied as many times, as the Machine computation  capabilities may allow, to do mutli-agent control of independent quadrotors.

This control design method is conceptually similar to Bode's frequency-response methods. H-infinity loop-shaping can be applied to multivariable design problems, and uses optimization to produce robust performance and stabilization.There are two Simulink models: one is a standalone plant model for linearization, and the other is the full closed-loop model with the closed-loop controller and an external disturbance model.  The design is performed using a MATLAB script - this works best when run in cell mode, since it generates lots of plots on the way.This example is intended as a teaching aid, and I would be very interested in feedback that I can use to improve it.The example uses the shipping F14 demo model supplied by MathWorks, which I would like to acknowledge - the copyright for that belongs to them, not to me!</p>","control design,robust control,simulink,teaching aids",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3985910-daniel-auger,2015-03-27 14:55:28.000000,2015-03-27 14:55:28.000000,1,1,4.0,22,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/50216/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2015, Daniel Auger

Worse yet, the user must name the individual signals going into the busCreator with the signal names defined in the bus object type.This tool's job is to do that favor for you. (Note that the tool itself is just a masked busCreator running some callback scripts so the inclusion of this tool does not overtly stick out in a design.) Details can be found in BOBCreadme.txt but essentially the tool's mask provides the user with candidate bus object types (From the workspace.) to choose from and upon selection and application of a bus object type the tool provides a busCreator with the necessary number of inputs and with those inputs populated with NAMED stubbed signal lines. These names match the BusElement names in the chosen bus object type. From these named stubbed lines the underlying busCreator inherits the names for ""Signals in the bus.""

Gravity is implemented as a constant downwards acceleration. The system behaves like a pendulum if the spring-constant is sufficiently large.Physical EntitiesThere is an anchor, a mass and a spring in the simulation. The mass follows the Newton's laws of motion under the forces applied on it, i.e. the force exerted by the spring, the force due to the gravity and the force of friction. The spring connects the mass to the anchor and applies a force on the mass, depending on its position. All forces, accelerations, velocities and positions are 2-d vectors. The base units are cm, s and kg.MassThe mass is made to follow the Newton's laws of motion and classical kinematics. The following equations are used to calculate its position from the forces acting on it.=&gt; F = Mb*g - kf*v + Fb=&gt; a = F / Mb=&gt; v = Vb + int(F)=&gt; Pos = Posb + int(v)Here, ""F"" is the total force acting on the mass, ""Mb"" is the value of the mass, ""g"" is the acceleration due to gravity, ""kf"" is the coefficient of friction, ""v"" is the instantaneous velocity of the mass, ""Fb"" is the external force acting on the mass, ""a"" is the instantaneous aceleration of the mass, ""Vb"" is the initial velocity of the mass, ""Pos"" is its instantaneous position, ""Posb"" is its initial position and int() denotes the integration function.SpringThe spring follows the Hooke's law with no limits. It takes the instantaneous position of the anchor and the mass and calculates the force exerted on the amss at that position. Its dynamics are defined using the following equations.=&gt; L = sqrt((Posa-Posb).(Posa-Posb))=&gt; e = L - Ls=&gt; Fsb = ks * (Posa-Posb) * e / LHere, ""L"" represents the instantaneous length of the spring, ""e"" is the extension, ""Ls"" is the initial or natural length of the spring, ""Fsb"" is the force exreted by the spring on the mass, and ""ks"" is the spring contant of the spring.DisplayThe display block creates an animation of the anchor, the mass and the spring using their positions.

Houck, J.A. Joines, M.G. Kay, that implements genetic algorithms for industrial plant identification and PID controller design. Case studies and examples included!This extension brings forth the practical aspect of using genetic algorithms in aiding plant modeling and PID control design for real world industrial processes. Plants such water tanks, heaters, fans and motors are usually hard to model or tune on-site, especially after prolonged use of the equipment when degradation of performances is inevitable. Therefore, this toolbox extension introduces a series of practical steps that can be taken by control engineers in order to re-design viable PID controllers for their plants.Inside the GAOT-ECM archive you will find two main folders: (1) Identification (for model identification) and (2) Control (for controller design).(1) runs a plant model identification genetic algorithm for LTI second order and first order with time delay systems.(2) runs a PID controller design genetic algorithm under various customizable performance criteria.The demonstration files offer real world case studies from which the user can learn step-by-step how to apply genetic algorithms to model identification and PID controller design.GAOT-ECM was implemented and tested under Matlab 7 (R2011b).

For other examples, please consult the GAOT-ECM: Extension For Control And Modeling main file.This extension brings forth the practical aspect of using genetic algorithms in aiding plant modeling and PID control design for real world industrial processes. Plants such water tanks, heaters, fans and motors are usually hard to model or tune on-site, especially after prolonged use of the equipment when degradation of performances is inevitable. Therefore, this toolbox extension introduces a series of practical steps that can be taken by control engineers in order to re-design viable PID controllers for their plants.Inside the GAOT-ECM Seismic Vibration Case Study archive you will find the folder: MR Damper, which runs a PID controller design genetic algorithm under various customizable performance criteria.For this case study, a base isolation system is considered for a three story building. The damper is mounted in the base of the structure, which is controlled via an LQR law on the outer loop of a cascaded control system. A PID controller is chosen to be designed using GAs for the inner loop containing the damper. The output forces generated by seismic dampers are required to be maintained between specific limits, so they do not cause instability to the structure, breaks support beams and so on. Therefore, a control loop for the actuator is required, that will receive the desired control forces computed by higher algorithms (such as robust laws, intelligent controllers, adaptive, modal, etc.) as setpoints and ensure that they are precisely reproduced by the actual damper output force. Analysis for validation and LQR command matrix are included.GAOT-ECM was implemented and tested under Matlab 7 (R2011b).Enjoy!Acknowledgements: GAOT-ECM Toolbox(GAOT - Extension For Control And Modeling ) was inspired by Genetic Algorithm Optimization Toolbox (GAOT) by C.R.

Illustrate concepts related to Energy Storage Systems (ESS). Show how to use public solar data time-series (TMY3 files) and how to create typical load profiles.A simple scenario has been chosen to illustrate one usage of this example: The objective is to determine appropriate sizing (power &amp; capacity) of an ESS equipment connected to a 600V community electrical system, in order to prevent the community from purchasing more power than agreed with the Utility company. Based on a given load profile, PV farm output, ESS power rating and capacity, the simulation will give the number of unavailability for a full year. This sizing study can be performed for various locations around the US.The authors are Pierre Giroux, Gilbert Sybille, Jacques Brochu, and Patrice Brunelle, from IREQ, Hydro-Quebec research institute, with the collaboration of Mathworks.</p>","data import,energy storage systems,irradiance,powergui phasor mode,public solar data timeseries,residential load profile",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/27135-patrice-brunelle,2015-06-10 13:09:49.000000,2015-06-10 13:09:49.000000,5,5,3.0,28,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/51137/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2015, Patrice Brunelle

The sample files illustrate a simple mechanism by which both UDP Stream and DataStream SDK can be accessed from a Simulink model.The new functionality available only in Tracker 3.0 and newer is the addition of a UDP stream containing Tracker object translation/rotation data. The UDP stream contains only a very small subset of the data available via the DSSDK.All of the examples consist of an s-function along with a Simulink model showing a block using the custom s-function in a simulation.Single object and multiple object examples on the same port are provided using the DSSDK as well as the UDP stream, the only difference in those examples is the method of data access.

Therefore, they should be restricted in scope to avoid inadvertent/unwanted access, hide low-level details, and reduce the number of inputs for testing. The Data Store Rescope Tool (formerly known as the Data Store Push-Down Tool) identifies the data stores that have scopes larger than necessary. Then, the declaration (Data Store Memory block) of each identified data store is pushed down the model hierarchy to the lowest level possible, such that all the references to the data store memory are still within its scope. Also, if references to a data store are outside of its scope, the Data Store Rescope Tool can be used for auto-correction: the data store’s declaration is first moved to the model's top level, and then pushed-down to minimize data store's scope as previously described.For instructions instructions and how to use the tool, see doc/DataStoreRescope_UserGuide.pdf.For more about the capabilities of the tool and how it can be used in model-based development with Simulink, see the two papers:Vera Pantelic, Steven Postma, Mark Lawford, Alexandre Korobkine, Bennett Mackenzie, Jeff Ong, Marc Bender, ""A Toolset for Simulink: Improving Software Engineering Practices in Development with Simulink,"" Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development (MODELSWARD 2015), SCITEPRESS, 2015, 50-61.

Layout readjustment is usually needed, and represents a tedious activity if performed manually. Although achieving a proper layout of a Simulink model is deemed very important, there does not exist a comprehensive commercial automatic layout tool for Simulink models. The Auto Layout Tool resizes models' blocks based on number of inputs and outputs, and organizes the signal lines such that the number of crossings is minimized. Auto Layout Tool can leverage three different layout approaches: 1) ""Graphviz"", a third-party open source tool for drawing graphs; 2) Matlab’s built-in ""GraphPlot"" layout capability; 3) an in-house ""DepthBased"" method. Approaches 1) and 3) can be utilized on any version of Matlab/Simulink, while approach 2) only works on R2015b+.For installation instructions and instructions on how to use the tool, see AutoLayout/doc/AutoLayout_UserGuide.pdf.For more about the capabilities of the tool and how it can be used in model-based development with Simulink, see the following two papers:Vera Pantelic, Steven Postma, Mark Lawford, Alexandre Korobkine, Bennett Mackenzie, Jeff Ong, Marc Bender, ""A Toolset for Simulink: Improving Software Engineering Practices in Development with Simulink,"" Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development (MODELSWARD 2015), SCITEPRESS, 2015, 50-61.

The experimental tests have been carried out in order to identify the parameters of ultracapacitor. The Maxwell Cell BCAP0310 (310 F) has been used in the study.  The model is dynamic, i.e. it reflects the transient state of ultracapacitor voltage. More details on the ultracapacitor model is presented in [1]. The parameterisation of the model allows to specify an ultracapacitor pack with a defined number of cells in series or parallel.The model is able to simulate terminal voltage of energy storage including the dependencies on state of charge and temperature. Performed studies allow to presume that the model adequately reflects ultracapacitor behaviour in the ranges of: - temperature -5°C – 40°C - cell voltage 0.5V – 2.7V  There is not possible to model pure variable resistors in PLECS, so a capacitive coupled variable resistor with very small capacitance has been used to model a series resistance.

It consists of Swing type generator. Unbalanced and Non-Linear Load is constructed using three bridge rectifiers connected to each phase and Neutral. Construction of Non-Linear load comprises only resistive and Inductive Load connected to the Bridge rectifier.A block called Shunt Active Filter is compensating the harmonic currents, Neutral current and reactive currents. This block is connected at the PCC through the circuit breaker. This block calculates the Instantaneous   active and reactive power of Non-Linear load based on Instantaneous P-Q theory . Thus obtained Active Power is filtered. Filtered Instantaneous Active Power together with Ploss, Reactive Power and neutral current are transformed to current in αβ frame.

The microgrid is connected tothe medium voltage level utility grid at the point of commoncoupling (PCC) through the circuit breakers. When a microgridis connected to the grid, the operational control of voltage andfrequency is done entirely by the grid; however, amicrogrid stillsupplies the critical loads at PCC, thus, acting as a PQ bus. Inislanded condition, a microgrid has to operate on its own, independentof the grid, to control the voltage and frequency of themicrogrid and hence, acts like a PV (power-voltage) bus. The operation and management in both the modes is controlled andcoordinated with the help of microsource controllers (MCs) atthe local level and central controller (CCs) at the global level.Similar to the traditional synchronous generator frequencycontrol [3], themicrogrid voltage and frequency control can alsobe performed using droop control methods [4]–[8]. The presentwork provides fast response characteristics for voltage and frequencycontrol as compared to the secondary control consideredin [8]. The analogy between inverter control and the synchronousgenerator control in an islanded microgrid is studiedin detail in [9]. In the islanded mode, there is the necessity ofhaving a reference voltage and frequency signals in the microgridinverter control [10].The operation and control of the inverter interface of renewable-based distributed energy resources (DERs), like SolarPhotovoltaic (PV) in a microgrid, is a real challenge, especiallywhen it comes to maintaining both microgrid voltage and frequencywithin an acceptable range. A voltage control methodbased on traditional droop control for voltage sag mitigationalong with voltage ride through capability is proposed in [11].A dynamic voltage regulation based on adaptive control isproposed in [12], [13]. However, there are not many researchworks performed on V-f or P-Q control using solar PV includingMPPT control and battery storage in microgrids. In[14], frequency regulation with PV in microgrids is studied;however, this work does not consider the voltage controlobjective and lacks battery storage in the microgrid.In [15], a small scale PV is considered in a grid-connectedmode to control the active and reactive power of the system.Here, the control methods consider abc-dq0 transformation andvice versa which is avoided in the present paper. In [16], powermodulation of solar PV generators with an electric double layercapacitor as energy storage is considered for frequency control.In [17], load frequency control is implemented in microgridwithPV and storage; however, this work also lacks the considerationof a voltage control objective. The voltage and frequency controlwith solar PV and battery in microgrid with an inductionmachine is investigated in [18]; however, this work does not explainthe transfer mechanism of controls to consider the batterySOC constraint. In summary, the previous works in this topiceither lack the incorporation of an energy storage componentor the voltage control objective along with frequency controlor the incorporation of control transition in different scenarios.The present work fulfills these gaps by considering all of theseobjectives.</p>","battery_system_management,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,boost conveter,inverter,simulation,simulink,solar",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/6659096-priya-nandhu,2015-06-30 09:40:46.000000,2015-06-30 09:40:46.000000,148,63,4.0,302,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/51842/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2015, priya nandhu

The DPFC can be considered as a UPFC with an eliminated common dc link. The active power ex-change between the shunt and series converters, which is through the common dc link in the UPFC, is now through the transmission lines at the third-harmonic frequency. The DPFC employs the distributed FACTS (D-FACTS) concept, which is to use multiple small-size single-phase converters instead of the one large-size three-phase series converter in the UPFC. The large number of series converters provides redundancy, thereby increasing the system reliability. As the D-FACTS converters are single-phase and floating with respect to the ground, there is no high-voltage isolation required between the phases. Accordingly, the cost of the DPFC system is lower than the UPFC. The DPFC has the same control capability as the UPFC, which comprises the adjustment of the line impedance, the transmission angle, and the bus voltage.

There currently exist various competing technologies for wind generator systems whose differences lie in the complexity, cost and degree of control over the system characteristics. In the wind energy conservation system, the wind turbine captures the wind energy. Then the generator changes it to the electrical power. Wind turbines are classified into two types as fixed speed wind turbine and variable speed wind turbine. Variable speed wind turbines yield more energy than the fixed speed wind turbines, reduce power fluctuations and improve reactive power supply. Basically direct drive Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and Double Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) are used in variable speed wind turbine generator. In this paper, the simulations of a variable-speed wind turbine with a permanent magnet synchronous generator and power electronics devices have been analyzed to performance during various input wind velocities.

Frequency of output voltage can be controlled by varying the periodic time T.Thyristor T1, T2 are in series across the source ; Thyristors T1, T4, or T3, T4 are also in series across the source. During inverter operation, it should be ensured that two SCRs in the same branch, such as T1, T2 in diagram, do not conduct simultaneously as this would lead to a direct short circuit of the source.The main  drawback of half-bridge inverter is that it requires 3-wire dc supply.

Time response plots of various parameters for both Wind turbine and Synchronous generator with and without AGC is provided. A matlab code is written to plot corresponding curves. The disturbance occurs at t= 50 sec and the AGC control loop activates at t=110 sec once the commands is received from the transmission system operator.

In this situation, the movements are performed taking into account the insertion point (fulcrum). To solve this issue, a Jacobian based position control scheme has been used, which is able to generate the manipulator joint angles references to perform a movement taking into account a previously fixed fulcrum point. The obtained joint angles are then used to animate a 3D model (VRML) of the 6DoF manipulator. Morever, this 3D model allows to place the instrument tip at any orientation using Euler ZYZ angles or a rotation matrix. The 3D model can also be used for teaching or research purposes, e.g. to calculate its kinematics.The Jacobian based position control scheme has been presented in the paper:Perez-del-Pulgar, C.J.; Munoz, V.F.; Velasco, J.J.; Gomez, R., ""Parallel force-position control scheme with fuzzy gain tuning for single port laparoscopic surgery,"" in Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS), 2013 13th International Conference on , vol., no., pp.101-106, 20-23 Oct. 2013. doi: 10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703871Please, reference this paper if you use the model.This work has been developed by the University of Malaga students:Ana María Gómez DelgadoJosé Ricardo Sánchez IbáñezIgnacio Alzugaray LópezPedro Cervera PedregosaJuan José Velasco Manzanares</p>","control,robot,robotics",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/4971153-carlos-perez-del-pulgar,2015-12-15 17:38:30.000000,2015-12-15 17:38:30.000000,0,3,5.0,22,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/54455/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2015, Carlos Pérez del Pulgar

Several of these systems are presently in operation, forexample the INELFE project (France-Spain interconnection), the Dolwin1 project(offshore wind HVDC link), or planned for future projects such as the Northern Pass(Canada-USA 1090-MW DC link).Our example will illustrate one typical VSC topology used nowadays: the Modular MultilevelConverters (MMC) technology. In the example, MMC converter is implementedusing an aggregate model to simulate 36 power modules per arm. With this aggregatemodel, control system dynamics, converter harmonics and circulating currentsphenomena are all well-represented. However, having only one virtual capacitor torepresent the 36 capacitors of the arm, the model assumes that capacitor voltages of allpower modules are well-balanced. The aggregate model runs much faster than a detailedmodel that would use two switching devices and one capacitor for each individual powermodule. This aggregate model is also well-suited for real-time simulation.Simulating our SPS model for 10 seconds allows observation of the interconnectionoperation during start-up (capacitor charging), voltage regulation, and power regulation.A comparison between this aggregated model and a SPS detailed model is also provided.A Help File containing useful information on the model is included as well.</p>","control systems,dc interconnection,high voltage direct current hvdc,modular multilevel converter mmc,pwm modulation,renewables,switching function,transmission system,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2170933-pierre-giroux,2015-12-14 20:42:59.000000,2015-12-14 20:42:59.000000,10,11,5.0,59,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/54506/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2015, Pierre Giroux

This is helpful in quantifying soft-real-time performance.The POSIX gettimeofday() function has resolution down to microseconds but windows and linux have good resolution to around10ms and about 1ms, respecctively, depending.The S-function builder auto-generates a .tlc file and generates a fully-inlined S-function that is helpful in targeting the Raspberry Pi device(or any other Simulink Coder target).getSystemClockTimeval.c works on the host PC and also the Raspberry Pi runnning Debian Wheezy linux. The simulink code computes the differnce betweenthe operating system's local time and the simulation time then logs that to a file. The write-to-file block works on the host or the targeted Raspberry Pi.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This Simulink model was tested and runs on R2015b on Windows 10 with the gcc MinGW 64-bit compiler.To run this model on a PC with Matlab, double click the light blue initiailzation block to specify h_fixed=0.1 seconds, then open the s-function builder block, hit build, and upon successfully creating the s-function getSystemClockTimeval.c and associated .tlc file it will build getSystemClockTimeval.mexw64. You can then run the simulation on the host PC. It logs a matfile called myTestData.mat in the working directory.To run this file on the Rasperry Pi 2 model B, double click the initialization block to assign h_fixed=0.1 seconds, then open the S-function builder, build the s-function and associated .tlc file, then close that dialogue box.

There are no special libraries or additional toolboxes required.This Simulink model solves for the fixed terrain frame's XY position of the simple kinematic vehicle motion and visualizes the result using Matlab graphics. The Simulink model's base simulation timestep is h_fixed=0.05(s), or 50ms. On a 2Ghz Dell Inspiron laptop this model achieves near real-time operation at animation frame rates of 20fps to 30fps.The Ackermann steering relationship delta_Ack = L / R is an approximation for a vehicle of wheelbase length L and track width W turning without slipping on a constant radius circle at low speed.The Ackermann relationships are presented in Gillespie's 1992 text on page 186, Milliken and Milliken's 1995 text on page 128, or Wong's 2008 text page. 364. However none of these text's adequately and succinctly summarize the body-fixed velocity transformed into inertial, or terrain-fixed SAE XY coordinates. The handwritten notes provided here summarize the complete kinematic equation development.Software Versions Tested:-------------------------This model was developed and tested using Matlab R2014 and R2015 and should work with most other versions. The animation s-function is a modified version of the level 1 m-file s-function from the Mathworks example provided in sanim.m.Writing .jpeg animation frames to disk at each animation interval slows the simulation considerably. Set animation frames per second, anim_fps, in setup.m and re-run setup.m. Don't forget to turn off your file synchronization services to avoid syncing all the new image files.Getting started:-------------------------Get started by unzipping the .zip file, changing directories to the folder, then running setup.mat the Matlb command prompt. This will clear the workspace then populate it with the necessary variables to run the Simulink model and associated animation. It will also open the Simulink model file. Press Play or Simulation | Run to execute the Simulink model.

The support package lets you to design and run algorithms on Android-based Samsung smartphones and tablet devices using its sensors as inputs and the screen as an output.This Simulink model makes use of blocks from the support package to implement a color detection algorithm on a live video feed from the camera of the Android device. The algorithm is designed to use the camera of the smartphone or tablet device, detect a color specified as a ""reference"", replace it with a predefined color, and display the resulting video on the screen of the Android device.The reference color is defined in the ""Reference_Color"" block. The color detection algorithm is found in the ""Color Detection"" subsystem block, which makes use of MATLAB Function blocks to implement the color matching logic. The detected color is then ""marked"" (or replaced) with the color defined by the marking blocks, containing values for the R, G, and B components.With the Simulink® Support Package for Samsung GALAXY® Android™ Hardware, you can design signal or image processing algorithms and applications for Android devices from Simulink. You can also develop more elaborate algorithms using the DSP System Toolbox and the Computer Vision System Toolbox.For more information, examples, requirements of this support package and other recommended products, please visit the following hardware catalog page:<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/android-programming-simulink.html"">http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/android-programming-simulink.html</a></p>","android,camera,color detection,computer vision,maker,mobile",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/5168161-greg-drayer,2016-05-23 16:06:44.000000,2016-05-23 16:06:44.000000,0,1,5.0,4,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/55040/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, Greg Drayer Andrade

It is given at the beginning of the text as it is a necessary interface between control algorithms and sensors. Chapter 2 describes RLS and Kalman filter state estimation approaches to fault detection and includes an example. Chapter 3 has to do with control system design to mitigate the effects of disturbances, including disturbance accommodating control, H∞, Active Disturbance Rejection Control and harmonic oscillation control. Chapter 4 has a few adaptive control methods that are described including model reference adaptive control, L1 Adaptive Control, and model free adaptive control. Chapter 5 describes ways to tune proportional integral derivative (PID) control algorithms. This is the most commonly used and, therefore, most important control algorithm. Chapter 6 describes several adaptive and non-adaptive feedforward control techniques. Chapter 7 has a few applications that may be of interest to the reader.

Measurement and digital signal processor delays have been compensated by using a modified Kalman filter. The control variable states can be estimated one sample in advance with a reduced number of sensors. Two current control loops with the steepest descent adaptive control for grid voltage estimation have been employed to boost robustness. Stability and dynamic performance have been examined for different state variables using root locus. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed control approach. A PLL performs the transformation from a three-phase stationary reference frame to a two-phase synchronously rotating reference frame. The control system dynamics are investigated to assess system stability and to select feedback variables. Simulation and practical results verify the derived expressions and system performance. With the modified Kalman filter, the control state variables are predicted one sample in advance and the number of measurement sensors is reduced. The fluctuations are reflected to the dc side, as harmonic frequencies that are sourced from the dc-link capacitor. The harmonic impedance is determined by the proportional gain of the controller. From the Bode analysis, it is clear that the system with inductor voltage feedback is inherently more stable against low-order frequency harmonics than the other feedback control variables. The performance of the control algorithm described has been investigated using MATLAB/SIMULINK simulations. The proposed controller bandwidth is extended compared to the conventional controller; hence, the proposed delay compensation technique enhances the digital controller bandwidth. The experimental system was implemented with the same system parameters as the simulated studies. The results show that the currents are balanced and high quality sinusoidal. The switching frequency content is minimized with the presence of the –filter with the isolating transformer.

1712,57512,Proposed Five Phase Transformer with Motor Drive Load,INDRANIL SAAKI,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57512-proposed-five-phase-transformer-with-motor-drive-load,Indranil Saaki,"<p>The first five-phase induction motor drive system was proposed in the late 1970s for adjustable speed drive applications. Since then, a considerable research effort has been in place to develop commercially feasible multiphase drive systems. Since the three-phase supply is available from the grid, there is a need to develop a static phase transformation system to obtain a multiphase supply from the available three-phase supply. Thus, this project proposes a novel transformer connection scheme to convert the three-phase grid supply to a five-phase fixed voltage and fixed frequency supply. The proposed transformer connection outputs five phases and, thus, can be used in applications requiring a five-phase supply. Currently, the five-phase motor drive is a commercially viable solution. The five-phase transmission system can be investigated further as an efficient solution for bulk power transfer with the wavelet technique. The connection scheme is elaborated by using the simulation and experimental approach to prove the viability of the implementation and detect faults in the transformer using wavelets. The geometry of the fabricated transformer is elaborated in this paper.

1713,57514,simulation of DPFC  designed by indraneel saki,INDRANIL SAAKI,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57514-simulation-of-dpfc-designed-by-indraneel-saki,indraneel saki,"<p>The Distributed Power Flow Controller (DPFC) is a new device within the FACTS family. It is emerged from the UPFC and has relatively low cost and high reliability. The DPFC consists of two types of converters that are in shunt and series connection with grids. The common dc link between the shunt and the series converters is eliminated. The active power exchange between the shunt and series converters that is through the common dc link in the UPFC, though the transmission line at the 3rd harmonic frequency. The redundancy of the series converters provides the high reliability of the system. In this Project, the DPFC behavior during the failure of a single series converter unit is considered. A control scheme to improve the DPFC performance during the failure is proposed. The principle of the control is based on the facts that, the failure of single series converter will lead to unsymmetrical current at the fundamental frequency. By controlling the negative and zero sequence current to zero, the failure of the series converter is compensated.              In this Project, the principle of the DPFC is first introduced and followed by the behavior of the DPFC during the failure of a single series converter. The design of the control scheme and corresponding simulations are presented by using matlab/simulink.This guide is useful to anyone who would like to contribute to open source projects on MATLAB.

This paper investigates the application of a new adaptive logic fuzzy controller (FLC) for the speed control of field oriented PMSM fed by voltage source inverter. A model-reference adaptive scheme is proposed in which the adaptation mechanism is executed by fuzzy logic based on the error and changes of error measured between the motor speed and the output of a reference model. To make the controller less dependent on the quality of the expert knowledge, the fuzzy speed controller is augmented by the model following error driven fuzzy adaptive mechanism to provide fast and robust control for various operating conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed control is illustrated by numerical simulation resultsThis guide is useful to anyone who would like to contribute to open source projects on MATLAB.

Under the smart grid environment, DG units should be included in the system operational control framework, where they can be used to enhance system reliability by providing backup generation in isolated mode, and to provide ancillary services (e.g. voltage support and reactive power control) in the grid-connected mode. To meet these requirements for consumers, the proposed flexible interface utilizes a fixed power–voltage–current cascaded control structure to minimize control function switching and is equipped with robust internal model control structure to maximize the disturbance rejection performance within the DG interface. The proposed control system facilitates flexible and robust DG operational characteristics such as 1) active/reactive power (PQ) or active power/voltage (PV) bus operation in the grid-connected mode, 2) regulated power control in autonomous micro-grid mode, 3) smooth transition between autonomous mode and PV or PQ grid connected modes and vice versa, 4) reduced voltage distortion under heavily nonlinear loading conditions, and 5) robust control performance under islanding detection delays. Evaluation results are presented to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed Grid controller.This guide is useful to anyone who would like to contribute to open source projects on MATLAB.

1724,57577,An Integrated Hybrid Power Supply for DG,INDRANIL SAAKI,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57577-an-integrated-hybrid-power-supply-for-dg,by indranil saaki,"<p>A new, hybrid integrated topology, fed by photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cell (FC) sources and suitable for distributed generation applications, is proposed. It works as an uninterruptible power source that is able to feed a certain amount of power into the grid under all conditions. PV is used as the primary source of power operating near maximum power point (MPP), with the FC section (block), acting as a current source, feeding only the deficit power. The unique “integrated” approach obviates the need for dedicated communication between the two sources for coordination and eliminates the use of a separate, conventional dc/dc boost converter stage required for PV power processing, resulting in a reduction of the number of devices, components, and sensors. Presence of the FCsource in parallel (with the PVsource) improves the quality of power fed into the grid by minimizing the voltage dips in the PVoutput.Another desirable feature is that even a small amount of PV power (e.g., during low insolation), can be fed into the grid. On the other hand, excess power is diverted for auxiliary functions like electrolysis, resulting in an optimal use of the energy sources. The other advantages of the proposed system include low cost, compact structure, and high reliability, which render the system suitable formodular assemblies and “plug-n-play” type applications. All the analytical, simulation, and experimental results of this research are presented.This guide is useful to anyone who would like to contribute to open source projects on MATLAB.

The main purpose of this project is to show that the magnetic energy recovery switch (MERS) can be an attractive new series compensator by applying appropriate control.The MERS is similar to a single-phase full bridge, meaning that compared to the gate-commutated series capacitor, it has twicethe number of active switches. However, advantages, such as the double voltage–current operating range, eliminating the need for reverse blocking switches, zero current turn-on, and a lower current conduction period of each switch can make the MERS an attractive alternative. The basic characteristics of the MERS have been found to be similar to a series connection of a voltage source and a capacitor in steady state. With this dual characteristic, a control method has been developed where the minimization of the harmonics in the series-injected voltage and stable operation during large setpoint changes have been achieved. The resulting subharmonic characteristic also indicates a low risk of subsynchronous resonance. Experimental results verify the proposed configuration and control.This guide is useful to anyone who would like to contribute to open source projects on MATLAB.

It is proposed to add an additional function to the inverter to decrease the negative-sequence voltage at the point of connection with the utility grid. Based on a symmetric sequence voltage decomposition and using an improved multi-variable filter, the grid-interfacing inverter intentionally absorbs a small amount of negative-sequence current from the grid, thereby helping to correct the negative-sequence voltage. Although the amplitude reduction contributed by each individual inverter system is small compared to the total negative-sequence component, grid interfacing inverter modules can collectively achieve substantial results in the grid. The integrated function and proposed control has been verified in simulations and by experiments on a laboratory prototype.This guide is useful to anyone who would like to contribute to open source projects on MATLAB.

In facilities with moderated power generation, the WF are connected through medium voltage (MV) distribution headlines. A situation commonly found in such scheme is that the power generated is comparable to the transport capacity of the grid. This case is known as Wind Farm to Weak Grid Connection, and its main problem is the poor voltage regulation at the point of common coupling (PCC). Thus, the combination of weak grids, wind power fluctuation and system load changes produce disturbances in the PCC voltage, worsening the Power Quality and WF stability. This situation can be improved using control methods at generator level, or compensation techniques at PCC. In case of wind farms based on SCIG directly connected to the grid, is necessary to employ the last alternative. Custom power devices technology (CUPS) result very useful for this kind of application. In this paper is proposed a compensation strategy based on a particular CUPS device, the Unified Power Quality Compensator (UPQC). A customized internal fuzzy logic control scheme of the UPQC device was developed to regulate the voltage in the WF terminals, and to mitigate voltage fluctuations at grid side. The internal control strategy is based on the management of active and reactive power in the series and shunt converters of the UPQC, and the exchange of power between converters through UPQC DC–Link. This approach increase the compensation capability of the UPQC with respect to other custom strategies that use reactive power only. Simulations results show the effectiveness of the proposed compensation strategy for the enhancement of Power Quality and Wind Farm stability.This guide is useful to anyone who would like to contribute to open source projects on MATLAB.

Due to the price hike of the fossil fuels and the concern of the global warming, the development of wind power has rapidly progressed over the last decade. Many countries have set goal for high penetration levels of wind generations. Recently, several large-scale wind generation projects have been implemented all over the world. It is economically beneficial to integrate very large amounts of wind capacity in power systems. Unlike other traditional generation facilities, using wind turbines present technical challenges in producing continuous and controllable electric power. With increase in contribution of wind power into electric power grid, energy storage devices will be required to dynamically match the intermitting of wind energy.     When wind turbines are connected to a grid, they should always maintain constant power. In order to maintain constant active power, the use of Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) with Energy Storage System (ESS) like super capacitor (or) batteries can be used, with a two layer control scheme. In the two layers control there is a high-layer controller known as Wind Farm Supervisory Control (WFSC), which generates the active power (P), Stator Power (Ps), Energy storage power (Pe), DC voltage (Vdc) etc., references for the low-layer WTG controllers. The low-layer controller has two different controls i.e., Grid side controller (GSC) and Rotor side controller (RSC) which are used to control the AC/DC/AC converters of DFIG wind turbines and to generate the desired active power demand specified by the grid operator. Simulation is carried out in Matlab to evaluate the performance of wind farm equipped with 15 DFIG wind turbines with and without ESS to provide a constant active power of 36MW.This guide is useful to anyone who would like to contribute to open source projects on MATLAB.

This work is dealing with damping of oscillations in an SMIB system by a proposed combination of PSS and STATCOM. A new additional support for PSS even during severe disturbances is also provided by proposed fuzzy controller. STATCOM is also added to power system to exchange reactive power and to inject active power which will further enhance damping of oscillations          STATCOM is one of the most significant devices in FACTS technology which is used in parallel compensation, enhancing the transient stability, limiting the low frequency oscillations and etc. designing a proper controller is effective in operation of STATCOM. In this work, the equations that describe the proposed system have been linearized and then the fuzzy logic controller has been designed for power System stabilizer. Damping the transients of the synchronous generator is the aim of designing of fuzzy logic controller whether the input power of generator has been changed suddenly. The fuzzy logic controller performance in a SMIB system is also examined using simulation studies and the results validate the efficiency of the proposed controller.This guide is useful to anyone who would like to contribute to open source projects on MATLAB.

The front end of this PFC converter is a diode bridge rectifier (DBR) fed from pv power generation. The PMBLDCM is used to drive a compressor load of an air conditioner through a three-phase VSI fed from a controlled DC link voltage. The speed of the compressor is controlled to achieve energy conservation using a concept of the voltage control at PV DC link proportional to the desired speed of the PMBLDCM. Therefore the VSI is operated only as an electronic commutator of the PMBLDCM. The stator current of the PMBLDCM during step change of reference speed is controlled by a rate limiter for the reference voltage at DC link. The proposed PMBLDCM drive with PV voltage control based PFC converter is designed, modelled and its performanceis simulated in Matlab-Simulink environment for an air conditioner compressor driven through a 1.5 kW, 1500 rpmPMBLDC motor.

The HAPF is the combination of active and passive power filters. The aim in the HAPF design is to complement or enhance the performance of the active power filter or passive power filter by adding passive or active components to its structure. HAPF is categorized in parallel hybrid active power filters (PHAPFs) and series hybrid active power filters (SHAPFs) based on the used active filter type. A series of PHAPFs was proposed after the 1990s. Cheng et al. proposed a new hybrid active power filter to achieve the power-rating reduction of the active filter. But the active power filter still bears the fundamental voltage in this design. In this project a novel HAPF with injection circuit was proposed. The novel topology has great promise in reducing harmonics with a relatively low capacity APF. For harmonic current tracking controls, there are two schemes: One is the linear current control, such as ramp comparison control, deadbeat control, sinusoidal internal model control, generalized integrators control, etc.; the other is nonlinear current control, such as hysteresis control, predictive control, etc.This project deals with a hybrid active power filter with injection circuit (IHAPF). It shows great promise in reducing harmonics and improving the power factor with a relatively low capacity active power filter. An adaptive fuzzy dividing frequency-control method composed of a generalized PI control unit and fuzzy adjustor unit was proposed. In the new control scheme, the generalized PI control unit is used to achieve dividing frequency control; the fuzzy adjustor unit is used to adjusted parameters of the PI control unit to produce better adaptive ability and dynamic response. At the same time, the control strategy is generally useful and applicable to other active filters. This project concluded that the stability of the IHAPF based on detection supply current is superior to that of others. To minimize the capacity of IHAPF, an adaptive fuzzy dividing frequency-control method is proposed by analyzing the bode diagram, which consists of two control units: a generalized integrator control unit and fuzzy adjustor unit. The generalized integrator is used for dividing frequency integral control, while fuzzy arithmetic is used for adjusting proportional-integral coefficients timely. And the control method is generally useful and applicable to any other active filters. Compared to other IHAPF control methods, the adaptive fuzzy dividing frequency control shows the advantages of shorter response time and higher control precision. The simulation and experimental results show in  marine and offshore industry.  that the new control method is not only easy to be calculated and implemented, but also very effective in reducing harmonics.</p>","apf,dividing frequency control,dsatcom,fuzzy adjustor,generalized integrator,harmaonics,hybrid active power filter hapf,hybride active power filters,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,marine applications,power quality",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2016-06-21 13:02:17.000000,2016-06-21 13:02:17.000000,7,3,5.0,26,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/57720/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

The wavelet transform is applied first to decompose the current signals of the power transformer into a series of detailed wavelet components. The values of the detailed coefficients obtained can accurately discriminate between an internal fault and magnetizing inrush currents in power transformers. The detailed coefficients are further used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The trained ANN clearly distinguishes an internal fault current from magnetizing inrush current. A typical 750 MVA, 27/420KV, �/Y power transformer connected between a 27KV source atthe sending end and a 420KV transmission line connected to an infinite bus power system at thereceiving end were simulated using MATLAB/ PSCAD/EMTDC software. The generated data were used by theMATLAB software to test the performance of the proposed technique. The simulation results obtainedshow that the new algorithm is more reliable and accurate.

Due to the price hike of the fossil fuels and the concern of the global warming, the development of wind power has rapidly progressed over the last decade. Many countries have set goal for high penetration levels of wind generations. Recently, several large-scale wind generation projects have been implemented all over the world. It is economically beneficial to integrate very large amounts of wind capacity in power systems. Unlike other traditional generation facilities, using wind turbines present technical challenges in producing continuous and controllable electric power. With increase in contribution of wind power into electric power grid, energy storage devices will be required to dynamically match the intermitting of wind energy.     When wind turbines are connected to a grid, they should always maintain constant power. In order to maintain constant active power, the use of Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIG)— In this project, intelligent control scheme using artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based variable speed wind turbine system. ANN based rotor loop design is developed for variable speed wind turbine and therotor side controller is proposed for DFIG to improve its transient performance in all wind speed conditions. For comparative analysis,the conventional vector control scheme is also implemented for the system under investigation. It is observed, from the results, that the dynamic performance of the DFIG is improved with the proposed intelligent control scheme, as compared to the conventional control.The simulations are carried out using MATLAB platform.</p>","artificial neural network ann,doubly fed induction generator dfig,indraneel,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,intelligent control,variable speed wind turbine,vector control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2016-06-23 12:32:19.000000,2016-06-23 12:32:19.000000,4,3,5.0,24,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/57829/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of distance relays on transmission lines with FACTS devices applied for mid point control. Effect of two types of  FACTS devices, Unified Power flow controller (UPFC) and Static SynchronousCompensators (STATCOM) are studied. The project is conducted in three stages. First the situation is studied analytically, where the errors introduced in the impedance measurement due to the presence of  FACTS devices on the line are analyzed. In the second stage, the situation is simulated using transient simulation matlab/EMTDC software. In this method, the response of FACTS devices for different fault conditions and system conditions is also modeled.This method brings out some unique problems that would be experienced by the distance relays due to some specific characteristics of the FACTS devices. Finally, the findings are confirmed by testing a commercial distance relay using a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).

Among the loads, the effects of pulsed loads are most detrimental for the power quality of ship power distribution system as the pulsed loads require a very high amount of power for a very short period of time [1]. In order to improve the survivability of a navy ship in battle condition, DSTATCOM or Distribution Static Compensator can be used, which reduces the impact of pulsed loads on the bus voltage and thus keeps the bus voltage at desired level.Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM) is a shunt compensation device which is generally used to solve power quality problems in distribution systems. In an all-electric ship power system, these power quality problemsmainly arise due to the pulsed loads, which causes the degradation of the entire system performance. This projectpresents the application of DSTATCOM to improve the power quality in a ship power system during and afterpulsed loads. The control strategy of the DSTATCOM plays an important role in maintaining the voltage at the point of common coupling. A novel adaptive control strategy for the DSTATCOM based on artificial  system (AIS) isproposed. The optimal parameters of the controller are first found using particle swarm optimization. This provides a sort of innate immunity to common system disturbances.For unusual system disturbances, these optimal parameters are modified online, thus providing adaptive immunity in the control system. To evaluate the performance of the DSTATCOM and the AIS adaptive controller, a ship power system is developed in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The effectiveness of the DSTATCOM and the AIS controller is examined for pulsed loads of different magnitudes and durations.</p>","ann controller,dfacts,dstatcom,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,power quality,pso",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2016-07-03 21:41:27.000000,2016-07-03 21:41:27.000000,3,6,4.0,32,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/57990/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

Beyond the operational limit, the PV generation supplies negative damping torque, Thus damping system oscillation stability. Hence for the safe penetration of PV generation into power systems. The operational limit of oscillation stability of the PV power plant must be considered.The fast development of photovoltaic (PV) technology in recent two decades strongly indicates that in medium to long term, PV generation will become one of most attractive renewable energy sources in large-scale applications. Evidence of such indication is that the growth of demand on solar energy has consistently been by over 20% per annum due to the decreasing cost and price. The European Union is well on the track to fulfilling its own target of 3GW PV generation by 2010; while capacity of PV generation in the UK is forecasted to 30GW by 2050 Grid connection is the operational practice of large-scale PV generation for its best utilization. Large scale grid-connected PV generation will significantly affect power transmission and generation systems. In this aspect, one of the most important issues is the impact of large penetration of PV generation on power system stability, which must be examined carefully Dynamic of PV generation is considerably different with that of conventional generation involving rotating machines. Hence a thorough study on the case of interaction of PV generation with conventional power generation and transmission .systems is an urgent task to be pursued.

The conventional DTC drive contains a pair of hysteresis comparators.DTC drives utilizing hysteresis comparators suffer from high torque ripple and variable switching frequency. The most common solution to those problems is to use the space vector depends on the reference Torque and flux. This Project presents a review of the most popular control and modulation strategies studied for matrix converters (MCs) in the last decade. The purpose of most of these methods is to generate sinusoidal current on the input and output sides. These methods are compared considering theoretical complexity and performance. In this Project the space vector modulation Technique (SVPWM) is applied to 2 level inverter controls in the proposed DTC_SVM based induction motor drive system, thereby dramatically reducing the torque ripple. Then the controller based on space vector modulation is designed to be applied in the control of Induction Motor (IM) with a three-level Inverter.In This project concludes that the control strategy has a significant impact on the resonance of the MC input filter with EKF Technique. This type of Inverter has Several advantages over the standard two-level VSI, such as a greater number of levels in the output voltage waveforms, Lower dv/dt, less harmonic distortion in voltage and current waveforms and lower switching frequencies Eliminated By EKF Method. The SVM_DTC IM with MC Using EKF proposed scheme is described clearly and simulation results are reported to demonstrate its effectiveness.

This project discusses the use of an active power curtailment strategy to reduce PV power injection during peak solar irradiation to prevent voltage violation so that the PV penetration level of a distribution feeder can be in-creased to fully utilize solar energy. The PV power generation is simulated according to the hourly solar irradiation and tempera-ture data provided by the weather bureau. The voltage variation at the point of common coupling (PCC) is also derived by executing the 3-  load flow analysis to investigate the maximum PV power injection without causing a voltage violation problem. When using the proposed voltage control scheme for limiting PV power injec-tion into the study distribution feeder during high solar irradiation periods, the total power generation and total energy delivered by the PV system over a one-year period are determined according to the annual duration of solar irradiation. The annual cash flow from sales of PV power, the O&amp;M cost over the system life cycle, and the capital investment in the PV system are then used to calculate the payback years and the net present value (NPV) of the PV project. With the proposed voltage control to perform the partial genera-tion rejection of PV systems, the optimal installation capacity of PV systems can be determined by maximizing the net present value of the system so that better cost effectiveness of the PV project and better utilization of solar energy can be obtained.</p>","power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,distribution systems annual curve of solar irradiation,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,mppt technique,net present value,payback year,peak solar irradiation,photovoltaic,pv penetration level,renawable power generation,simulation",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2018-05-01 19:05:31.000000,2018-05-01 19:05:31.000000,4,2,5.0,22,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/58031/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

This hybrid system allows maximum utilization of freely available renewable energy sources like wind, fuel and photovoltaic energies. For this, an adaptive MPPT algorithm along with standard perturbs and observes method will be used for the system. The objective of this paper is to study a novel five and seven level multistring inverter topology for DERs based DC/AC conversion system. In this study, a high step-up converter is introduced as a front-end stage to improve the conversion efficiency of conventional boost converters and to stabilize the output DC voltage of various DERs such as PV, Wind and fuel cell modules for use with the simplified newly constructed multilevel inverter. The proposed multilevel inverter requires only six active switches instead of the eight required in the conventional cascaded H- bridge (CCHB) multilevel inverter, control with SVM technique.The inverter converts the DC output from non-conventional energy into useful AC power for the connected load. This hybrid system operates under normal conditions which include conventional and proposed cases of solar energy, fuel and wind energy.

The increasing application of power operating device can cause PQ disturbances. Avoiding the PQ disturbance and enhancing the PQ are the difficult tasks. More power electronics devices are used to overcome the PQ disturbances. Multi converter -Unified power quality conditioner (MC-UPQC) is one of the new power electronics devices that are used for enhancing the PQ. This project presents a new unified power-quality conditioning system (MC-UPQC), capable of simultaneous  compensation for voltage and current in multibus/multifeeder systems. In this configuration, one shunt voltagesource converter (shunt VSC) and two or more series VSCs exist. The system can be applied to adjacent feeders to compensate for supply-voltage and load current imperfections on the main feeder and full compensation of supply voltage imperfections on the other feeders. In the proposed configuration, all converters are connected back to back on the dc side and share a common dc-link capacitor. sharing with one DC link capacitor. The discharging time of DC link capacitor is very high, and so it is the main problem in MC- UPQC device. To eliminate this problem, an enhanced ANN based MC-UPQC is proposed in this paper. Initially, the error voltage and change of error voltage of a nonlinear load is determined. Then the voltage variation is applied separately to ANN-based controller. In order to regulate the dc-link capacitor voltage, conventionally, a proportional controller (PI) is used to maintain the dc-link voltage at the reference value. The transient response of the PI dc-link voltage controller is slow. So, a fast acting dc-link voltage controller based on the energy of a dc-link capacitor is proposed. The transient response of this controller is very fast when compared to that of the conventional dc-link voltage controller. By using fuzzy logic controller instead of the PI controller the transient response is improved. The DC capacitor charging output voltage is increased and the response is fast when compared with PI by using the ANN controller and hence, the PQ of the system is enhanced. The proposed controller is tested and the results of tested system and their performances are evaluated. Therefore, power can be transferred from one feeder to adjacent feeders to compensate for sag/swell and interruption. The performance of the proposed configuration has been verified through simulation studies using MATLAB/SIMULATION on a two-bus/two-feeder system show the effectiveness of the proposed configuration.</p>","power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,ann techniques,artificial neural network ann,control systems,dfacts,fuzzy controller,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,matlabsimulation multi converter unified powerquality conditione,mcupqc,power electronics,power quality pq,upqc,voltagesource converter vsc",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2019-12-03 22:02:55.000000,2019-12-03 22:02:55.000000,13,7,4.0,44,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/420f1724-c336-44c3-a055-9faebbf5a167/6fd33708-8384-4eaf-8add-b79105112598/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, Indranil Saaki

1788,58257,Unified Tuning of PID Load Frequency Controller for Multi Area  Power Systems via IMC,INDRANIL SAAKI,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/58257-unified-tuning-of-pid-load-frequency-controller-for-multi-area-power-systems-via-imc,indranil saaki,"<p>A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID) Load frequency controller is a generic control loop feedback mechanism (controller) widely used in industrial control systems. Frequency is a major stability criterion for large-scale stability in multi area power systems. To provide the stability, active power balance and constant frequency are required. Frequency depends on active power balance. To improve the stability of the power networks, it is necessary to design a load frequency control (LFC) systems that control the power generation and active power at tie lines.  The tie lines are utilities for contracted energy exchange between areas and provide inter-area support in abnormal conditions. Area load changes and abnormal conditions lead to mismatches in frequency and scheduled power interchanges between areas. These mismatches have to be corrected by LFC, which is defined as the regulation of the power output of generators within a prescribed area. Therefore, the LFC task is very important in interconnected power systems.For large scale power systems which normally consist of interconnected control areas, Load Frequency Control (LFC) is important to keep the system frequency and the inter area tie power as near to the scheduled values as possible. The input mechanical power to the generators is used to control the frequency of the output electrical power and to maintain the power exchange between the areas as scheduled. A well designed and operated power system should cope with changes in the load and with system disturbances, and it should provide acceptably high level of power quality while maintaining both voltage and frequency within tolerable limits.This project explains a unified PID tuning method for load frequency control (LFC) of power systems. The tuning method is based on the two-degree-of-freedom (TDF) internal model control (IMC) design method and a PID approximation procedure. The time-domain performance and robustness of the resulting PID controller is related to two tuning parameters. This project also explains the robust tuning of the two parameters. The method is applicable to power systems with non-reheated, reheated, and hydro turbines. Simulation results show that it can indeed improve the damping of the power systems. In this project it is also evident that the method can also be used in decentralized PID tuning for multi-area power systems.</p>","controller design,decentralized control,imc controller,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,internal model control imc,load frequency control lfc,load frequency controller,matlab,pid controller,pid tuning,power systems,robustness,simulation,simulink,single area power systems,two area power systems",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2018-05-01 18:56:14.000000,2018-05-01 18:56:14.000000,6,3,4.0,32,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/58257/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

The converter is capable of increased power transfer due to its three-phase power configuration, and it reduces the rms current per phase, thus reducing conduction losses. Further, interleaved operation of three-phase boost converter reduces overall ripple current, which is imposed into fuel cells and realizes smaller sized filter components, increasing effective operating frequency and leading to higher power density. Each output current of three-phase boost converter is combined by the three-phase transformer and flows in the continuous conduction mode by the proposed three-phase PWM strategy. An efficiency of above 96% is mainly achieved by reducing conduction losses and switching losses are reduced by the action of active clamp branches, as well. The proposed converter and three-phase PWM strategy are analyzed, simulated and implemented in hardware. Experimental results are obtained on a 500W prototype unit, with all of the design verified and analyzed.</p>","electric_motor_control,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,continuous conduction mode,fuel cell,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,interleaved operation,isolated boost converter,matlab,power electronics,power systems,renewable energy resourses,simulation,simulink,threephase dcdc converter,threephase pwm strategy",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2018-05-01 18:53:33.000000,2018-05-01 18:53:33.000000,1,2,5.0,15,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/58258/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

In addition to poor voltage profile, the power factor and harmonics of the system are the major concerns of the utility. A variety of power factor improvement &amp; harmonic minimization techniques are available ranging from various power factor-correcting devices to passive &amp; active harmonic filters.Electrical distribution system suffers from various problems like reactive power burden, unbalanced loading, voltage regulation and harmonic distortion. Though DSTATCOMS are ideal solutions for such systems, they are not popular because of the cost and complexity of control involved. Phase wise balanced reactive power compensations are required for fast changing loads needing dynamic power factor correcting devices leading to terminal voltage stabilization. Static Var Compensators (SVCs) remain ideal choice for such loads in practice due to low cost and simple control strategy. These SVCs, while correcting power factor, inject harmonics into the lines causing serious concerns about quality of the distribution line supplies at PCC. This paper proposes to minimize the harmonics injected into the distribution systems by the operation of TSC-TCR type SVC used in conjunction with fast changing loads at LV distribution level. Fuzzy logic system and ANN is used to solve this nonlinear problem, giving optimum triggering delay angles used to trigger switches in TCR. The scheme with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is attractive and can be used at distribution level where load harmonics are within limits.</p>","facts,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,lv distribution level,matlab,power control,power electronics,power systems,simulink,static var compensator,svc",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2018-05-01 18:47:58.000000,2018-05-01 18:47:58.000000,4,0,0.0,12,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/58267/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

A forty-eight pulse STATCOM evolved on two level gate turn-off thyristor based voltage source converters (GTO-VSCs) topology to be operated at fundamental frequency switching modulation is employed to have higher voltage gain in the midpoint of the transmission line enabling to achieve reasonable power gain in the system. Its magnetics is evolved with single stage magnetics that require only four transformers with its cumulative rating (MVA) equal to that of the controller itself and thus, leads to considerable saving in cost. Employing this STATCOM to be operated under voltage control mode, at mid-section of an EHVAC line, power system network is simulated using MATLAB platform. The simulation results show that the STATCOM is effective to reasonably increase the 132kV line loading.</p>","power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,48gto converter,control design,facts,flexiable ac transmission system,fundamental frequency switching,gateturn off thyristor,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,magnetics,phase shifting transformer,power electronics,power system,renewable energy resourses,statcom,voltage source converter",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2018-05-01 18:43:18.000000,2018-05-01 18:43:18.000000,2,1,5.0,12,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/58269/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

The circuit configuration of the proposed converter isvery simple. The proposed converter employs a coupled inductor with same winding turns in the primary and secondary sides. In step-up mode, the primary and secondary windings of the coupled inductor are operated in parallel charge and series discharge to achieve high step-up voltage gain. In step-downmode, the primary and secondary windings of the coupled inductor are operated in series charge and parallel discharge to achieve high step-down voltage gain. Thus, the proposed converter has higher step-up and step-down voltage gains than the conventional bidirectional dc–dc boost/buck converter. Under same electric specifications for the proposed converter and the conventional bidirectional boost/buck converter, the average value of the switch current in the proposedconverter is less than the conventional bidirectional boost/buck converter. The operating principle and steady-state analysis are discussed in detail.

It is essential that processes, in particular, in industrial plants, operate uninterrupted where high productivity levels are an important factor.The Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) is widely used in electrical power field to obtain the stability and good regulation of the electric system. In this paper, a novel ac automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is proposed. This AVR is configured by an input inductor, an output filter, a small-capacitance dc capacitor. This power converter acts as an ac boost converter when the utility voltage is lower than the specified voltage. On the contrary, this power converter acts as an ac buck converter when the utility voltage is higher than the specified voltage. Hence, the output voltage of the AVR can be maintained at the specified voltage. The salient feature of this AVR is that the power electronic switches are switched in high frequency therefore the switching loss of this AVR can be reduced and the capacitance of the dc capacitor is very small. Hence, the size and cost can be reduced, while the reliability and power efficiency can be increased. A prototype is developed and tested to verify the performance of the proposed AVR.</p>","electric_motor_control,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,ac boost converter,ac buck converter,automatic voltage regulator avr,indraneel saki,indranil saaki,modeling,power electonics,simulation,three arm ac voltage regulator",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2018-05-01 18:37:16.000000,2018-05-01 18:37:16.000000,4,4,5.0,21,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/58346/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

Model-based control of UPQC has attracted attentions in recent years, which aims to regulate the source current and the load voltage to the desired reference signals in spite of the existence of harmonic components in the supply voltage and the load current, possible sag or swell in the supply voltage, and variations in the load current. However,most of the previous studies did not take the control saturationexplicitly into their control design. This paper investigates the performance limit of UPQC under control input constraints by means of a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). MPC is an optimal control strategy that can take into account control constraints explicitly. Simulation studies, mainly focused on the comparison of performance between the MPC and a linear Multi-Variable Regulator (MVR), are carried out on a single-phase power distribution system to help us understand the performance limit under such control saturation.</p>","indraneel saki,indranil saaki,input constraints,model predictive control,mpc,power quality,simulation,unified power quality conditioner,upqc",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2018-05-01 18:31:07.000000,2018-05-01 18:31:07.000000,4,1,1.0,39,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/58347/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, indraneel saki ( indranil saaki )

An example is included for each of the three workflows.All examples provided can be used as templates to quickly prototype new beat-tracking ideas. In their present form, all files use a trivial high-latency beat detection algorithm based on finding the peaks of an all-positive version of the input signal. Depending on the particular example, the detected beats are returned as either MATLAB arrays (format required by the competition), numeric .txt files, or click sounds mixed onto the original signal.To use this material please refer to the ReadMe.txt file included in the archive.�For more resources on using MATLAB and Simulink for SP Cup 2017, visit <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/academia/student-competitions/sp-cup/For"">https://www.mathworks.com/academia/student-competitions/sp-cup/For</a> all the details on the SP Cup 2017, visit <a href=""http://signalprocessingsociety.org/sites/default/files/uploads/publications_resources/news/ICASSP_2017_SPCup.pdf"">http://signalprocessingsociety.org/sites/default/files/uploads/publications_resources/news/ICASSP_2017_SPCup.pdf</a></p>","audio,audio processing,beat,realtime,signal processing",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1297680-gabriele-bunkheila,2016-10-26 17:17:21.000000,2016-10-26 17:17:21.000000,0,0,0.0,2,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/59825/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, The MathWorks, Inc.

This files enable the use of a EPOS2 motor controller connected to a Linux machine, such as a Raspberry PI, for obtaining a better performance in simulation when compared with Windows OS.Example of how to use this files1. Download and install EPOS2 libraries in Raspberry PI. Copy *.so in /usr/lib, and replace *.h in /usr/include. Replace the original ""Definitions.h"" file with the one included in the zip.   Example of this step in linux:   cd ./EPOS_Linux_Library_Files/lib/arm/rpi   sudo mv libEposCmd.so.5.0.1.0 /usr/lib/libEposCmd.so   sudo mv libftd2xx.so.1.2.8 /usr/lib/libftd2xx.so  Copy the file ""Definitions.h"" to your SSD in Raspberry PI and use the following command   sudo mv ./Definitions.h /usr/include2. Extract the files in an empty directory in a windows computer.3. Open the example model ""test_MAXON_linux.slx"" and modify it according to your node ID and required EPOS2 mode. There are only three supported modes: position, velocity and current.4. Go to model options and change the values in pane ""Run On Target Hardware"", use your IP, user and password.5. Compile model in external mode and check for output.</p>","epos2 in simulink,electric_motor_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2142983-eugenio,2016-11-14 03:19:59.000000,2016-11-14 03:19:59.000000,1,0,0.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/60218/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, Eugenio

In the phase-shifted multicarrier modulation, all the triangular carriers have the same frequency and the same peak-to-peak amplitude, but there is a phase shift between any two adjacent carrier waves, given by Ɵcr = 360°/(m – 1). In the case of a 7-level CHB (m = 7), as we used in our project, all carrier waves (7-1 = 6) are 60o apart from the neighboring carrier waves. Similar to the phase-shifted modulation, an m-level CHB inverter using level shifted multicarrier modulation scheme requires (m – 1) triangular carriers, all having the same frequency and amplitude. The (m – 1) triangular carriers are vertically displaced such that the bands they occupy are contiguous. The frequency modulation index is given by mf = fcr/fm. In the case of a 7-level CHB (m = 7), as we used in our project, all carrier waves (7-1 = 6) are displaced from the neighbouring carrier waves.</p>","electric_motor_control,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,cascaded h_bridge inverter,chb converter,levelshifted carrierbased modulation,phaseshifted carrierbased modulation,power electronics,sevenlevel converter,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/7027599-muhammad-n-qureshi,2016-12-01 01:04:29.000000,2016-12-01 01:04:29.000000,2,4,5.0,18,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/60479/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2016, Muhammad N Qureshi

Normally a micro-controller is programmed using interrupt routines. We applied the Simulink Support Package for Arduino Hardware and achieved a feedback control system with constant control loop frequency up to 1 kHz. We could implement and test different control algorithm on real Maglev systems without writing any C-code.The sample time of the loop is given from both sources: the Step Function Block and the Analog Input Block, you must choose for both blocks the same sample time.

ELC is preferred. This ELC regulates speed, compensates reactive power and mitigates current harmonics.      It senses deviation in speed, then calculates power to be dumped(Pdump). Then, it senses load current and voltage from which p and q is calculated(pq theory). Then oscillating part of p (say p1) is found using digital filter. To compensates reactive power and mitigate current harmonics, p1 and q should be injected. To regulate speed, Pdump should be drawn. So, net power p1-Pdump is to be injected along with q. With this value, current to be injected is calculated. This reference current is fed to hysteresis band current controller which generates gate signal for inverter. Inverter injects the current.               Pdump drawn charges the capacitor C1 and C2. So, voltage across them increases. When sum of their voltage exceeds certain value (1025 V in this case), MOSFET switch S is turned on. So, capacitor is discharged to resistor.

This simulation model modifies the boost converter so that boost converter along with load works as pure resistor so that there is no harmonics in current in AC side.          It first measures output voltage and subtracts with reference voltage. Their difference is passed to PI controller which calculates power to be drawn. Voltage at the output of rectifier is measured. Then current proportional to the voltage is calculated where constant of proportionality determined by the power to be drawn. In this way, reference current is calculated. This reference current is compared with actual current. Then gate signal is generated by hysteresis band controller which is fed to switching MOSFET S. Since the voltage and current are proportional, it behaves as pure resistor. When pure resistor is used as load in rectifier, current at ac side is also sinusoidal. So, in this case too, current at AC side will be sinusoidal.</p>","power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,boost converter,harmonics,power filter,rectifier",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/9513772-niranjan-bhujel,2017-03-30 03:12:16.000000,2017-03-30 03:12:16.000000,0,0,0.0,10,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/62121/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2017, Niranjan Bhujel

2011,62371,Four Bar Linkage Optimization in Simscape,Steve Miller,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62371-four-bar-linkage-optimization-in-simscape,Four-bar linkage lengths are optimized using MATLAB to follow a desired trajectory.,"<p>This example shows a four-bar linkage modeled in Simscape Multibody that is optimized using MATLAB so that the tip of the linkage follows a desired trajectory. Mechanical designers often wish to design mechanisms that will enable an end effector to follow a certain path. The lengths of the links and the position of the end effector influence the trajectory of the end effector in a complex kinematic relationship. Optimization algorithms can be used to tune those lengths to achieve the desired motion.  The process is similar to what is described in the video “Computational Design of Mechanical Characters” <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfznnKUwywQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfznnKUwywQ</a> In this example, a parameter sweep is performed to see which trajectories are possible when varying a subset of the lengths. Then those lengths are tuned using MATLAB optimization algorithms until the resulting trajectory is within tolerances of the desired trajectory.Please read the README.txt file to get started.See how to use Simscape Multibody to model a cam-follower mechanism: <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/videos/modeling-contact-forces-in-a-cam-follower-94291.html"">https://www.mathworks.com/videos/modeling-contact-forces-in-a-cam-follower-94291.html</a>  Learn more about multibody simulation with Simscape Multibody by watching this webinar <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/videos/multibody-simulation-with-simmechanics-81877.html"">https://www.mathworks.com/videos/multibody-simulation-with-simmechanics-81877.html</a>  Find other Simscape examples by searching posts for the keyword ""physical modeling"" <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/?term=%22physical+modeling%22"">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/?term=%22physical+modeling%22</a>  Learn more about MathWorks Simscape Products: <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/physical-modeling/"">https://www.mathworks.com/physical-modeling/</a></p>","kinematic,kinematic synthesis,kinematics,mechanism,multibody,physical modeling",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/497498-steve-miller,2019-04-18 21:43:56.000000,2019-04-18 21:43:56.000000,3,2,5.0,25,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/71d9f03d-a526-49b7-a16f-c54a9c90d7d2/1b48066a-9f8d-4eea-99c1-00c269401d06/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, The MathWorks, Inc.

2013,62374,Water Wheel Generator in Simscape,Steve Miller,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62374-water-wheel-generator-in-simscape,Water wheel connected to electric generator modeled in Simscape,"<p>This example shows a water wheel modeled using Simscape Multibody.    This example models the transfer of power from hydraulic flow to an electrical system. Water flowing from a spout fills buckets on a water wheel. A hole in the bottom of each bucket allows the water to drain. The wheel is asymmetrically loaded (full buckets on one side, empty buckets on the other) which causes the wheel to turn. The wheel is connected through a gear to a generator which produces 12 volts across a resistive load. This example uses the General Variable Mass block from Simscape Multibody to model the varying mass, inertia, and center of gravity location in each bucket. This is coupled with a hydraulic model for the flow of water and an electrical network, all modeled in Simscape. Please read the README.txt file to get started.

No novelty is claimed here. The algorithm is based  on dq-gh transformation and sextant symmetry in the SV diagram, hence simplifying sector, region and duty cycle calculations. Neutral dc voltage balancing is achieved, by implementing the NTV sequencing method with logic operations on the state feedback of the current imbalance on the DC bus due to neutral current. Note that the algorithm is performed in per unit, however if you wish to use this model for control purposes, then simply divide your dq reference values by a half of the maximum synthesis voltage (based on your DC voltage). This model is made with consideration in implementing it in labview FPGA, hence various sections of the code are optimized for digital implementation with mostly add, subtract, invert, logic and signal routing functions. If you really wish to understand this model, I strongly suggest you find the above referenced paper and study it thoroughly. Any questions will be answered when I visit the site. This is my first time uploading, any criticism are very much welcome :)</p>","power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,power electronics,svm,svpwm,threelevel converter",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/5644421-xiaoming-hu,2017-04-07 08:44:25.000000,2017-04-07 08:44:25.000000,17,5,4.0,27,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/62463/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2017, xiaoming hu

THD for this current is very high. This harmonics needs to be eliminated. This can be done using full bridge. Current on ac side of full bridge can be controlled easily.                        Here, voltage of output capacitor is measured and subtracted with reference voltage. This difference is passed to PI controller which gives the value of power to be drawn from AC side to maintain the capacitor voltage. In steady state, this value is equal to power drawn by DC load. From the value of power, reference current in phase with input AC voltage is calcuated whose magnitude determined by the value of power to be drawn. In this way, reference current is calculated. This current is drawn from AC side where current being controlled by hysteresis band current controller. In this way, harmonics of current in AC side  can be mitigated.</p>","power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,harmonics,power filter,rectifier",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/9513772-niranjan-bhujel,2017-04-09 15:41:10.000000,2017-04-09 15:41:10.000000,3,1,5.0,16,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/62477/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2017, Niranjan Bhujel

The results prove that cascaded topology has better performance in comparison with other types. This topology was chosen for three reasons. First, the efficiency and reliability studies were conducted, and the CMLI was found to be the most efficient and reliable topology with minimum amount of power loss compared to other topologies. Second, it subdivides the battery string and increases the high voltage functionality. Finally, capacitor volume, cost and THD studies were again confirmed the effectiveness of this topology in battery energy storage systems.If you are using this package in your research or teaching, please include explicit mention of the reference paper:------Reference:A.

MATLAB code scans your 1G model, automatically converts as many of the 1G blocks as it can, and provides diagnostics indicating which 1G conventions need to be modified in order for the model to be compatible with 2G modeling conventions.  You can then assemble the automatically created 2G blocks into a model that behaves as the original 1G model.  Please read the README.txt file and the PDF file to get started. The PDF file explains the conversion process enabled by this tool, the diagnostics messages, and guides you through a tutorial exercise to help you get started converting your model.

The PV MPPT technique is designed with intelligent controller such fuzzy logic controller then simulated analysis in Matlab environment under different weather condition. This paper also focused bi-directional power flow from PV to battery and Battery to load with respected power demand. Therefore the fuzzy logic control based bi-direction converter has been developed in Matlab Simulink. Finally the proposed system PV output power is connected to DC-AC inverter and provides power supply to nearby loads.</p>,"fuzzy,hybrid,microgrid,mppt,pv,wind,battery_system_management,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1471187-dr-m-venkateshkumar,2017-06-03 18:03:31.000000,2017-06-03 18:03:31.000000,46,17,4.0,88,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/63235/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2017, Venkatesh Kumar M

Mutation of a Stateflow model means injecting a deliberate error into a state transition. Each mutant file has only one error. Simulink Design Verifier is then used to find the mutants. If an assertion fails it means that the mutant is killed. The script is able to generate mutants for this particular Stateflow model. With minor changes it should be able to mutate any Stateflow. Another batch script runs all the mutants in a loop and reports the results in a log file. The PDF file has a brief explanation of the work done. The intent of this exercise is to ascertain the SLDV performance on a complex aerospace problem. Earlier submission had a Simulink model and a M file function model for the same autopilot mode transition. The M File is modified here to write a sldv command for every requirement. This is then used to generate requirement based tests for the Stateflow model by falsifying the assertion.</p>,"aircraft,autopilot,formal methods,modes,stateflow",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/5987424-natasha-jeppu,2017-07-21 12:37:06.000000,2017-07-21 12:37:06.000000,0,1,5.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/63815/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2017, Natasha Jeppu

The purpose of this software is demonstration of non-linear sliding mode controller designed to control movement of platform mobile carrying robot with welding equipment. The main feature of  sliding mode controller is fast response and short settling time. The controller do not use the stable feedback but looks for fast unstable trajectories yielding near target point and switches between them as better one trajectory is found.

The project is to develop a depth controller for AUV to submerge accurately. The depth Simulink Arduino algorithm is implemented on an Arduino Mega using Model-Based Design (MBD) with MATLAB and Simulink. MBD used to model, simulate and verify the Simulink control algorithm after obtained data through open-loop experiment test. Then, it deploys and tests the algorithm on the embedded AUV hardware. The focus was in controlling the AUV vertical trajectory as the AUV tried to remain stationary at the desired depth and having its overshoot, rise time and settling time minimized.

2132,64295,Real Time GUI for Arduino System,Muhammad Naqiuddin Nazali,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64295-real-time-gui-for-arduino-system,A GUI that controls and monitors the signal of Arduino using Simulink in real time.,"<p>This project used Simulink with Arduino Hardware Support Package to control the behavior of Arduino UNO and observe the analog signal read from the similar Arduino UNO. The simulation was ran in External mode for infinite time to make it real time. The Simulink was then linked to a GUI so that the system can be controlled and observed in the easier interface.The GUI controls the parameter of Simulink blocks using set_param function. However, the crucial part was to send output signal from the Simulink to the GUI in real time. I have used a S-Functions as a sink in the Simulink to store the output value in an m-file. This m-file was then being read by the GUI and display the changes value in the real time as the value in the m-file changes.Before we start executing the files, here is the brief overview of the system. The PC must be connected to the Arduino UNO R3 through USB cable. The Arduino will controls an actuator using SPI Communication pin 10 with the power on/off controls through digital pin 8. This actuator will give voltage changes of an object. This analog voltage changes is then being measured by a sensor through pin A5.The files attached should be placed in the same path. Then, we can run the IMDC.m using MATLAB to initialize the GUI and the Simulink diagram. Once the user click on the TURN ON push button in the GUI, the Simulink will starts running the simulation in real time. The user can play around with the other buttons to see the behavior of the system through GUI.</p>","arduino,gui,realtime,simulation,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/9337121-muhammad-naqiuddin-nazali,2017-08-31 14:35:47.000000,2017-08-31 14:35:47.000000,0,1,4.0,12,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/64295/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2017, Muhammad Naqiuddin Nazali

2139,64373,The Schiaparelli Analysis,Yogananda Jeppu,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64373-the-schiaparelli-analysis,This is a simple analysis of the Schiaparelli failure using formal methods,"<p>The Schiaparelli was part of the ExoMars 2016 mission launched on a Proton rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The EDM, as it also known, was conceived with the objective to validate and demonstrate entry, descent and landing on Mars in preparation for the ExoMars 2020 mission. On 19 October 2016, the Schiaparelli module entered the Mars atmosphere at 14:42:07 (UTC). Schiaparelli continuously transmitted data during its descent into the Martian atmosphere. Schiaparelli’s signal was lost at 14:47:22 (UTC), about 43 seconds before the expected touchdown on Mars surface.A detailed failure analysis is reported as a document. The main cause was a large oscillatory body rate that caused the inertial sensor to saturate. The saturated value was integrated to provide the attitude angle. Cosine of this term was multiplied by the radio altimeter to get the correct height. During descent the angle became as high as 160 degrees causing a negative altitude to be sent into the controller which switched off the retro rockets.Simulink design verifier is used to find out if there is a chance of the altitude being negative. It brings out a counter example indicating how the altitude can be negative. Users can open the persistence block and change the value of 15 to lower. This change does not cause a negative altitude. This is also the finding in the report.This is a trivial example meant for students. This can be used in a formal methods class by the instructor.I would like to acknowledge Chethan CU who helped me with the problem and model.</p>","control,matlab,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2222682-yogananda-jeppu,2017-09-10 04:54:01.000000,2017-09-10 04:54:01.000000,0,0,0.0,0,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/64373/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2017, Yogananda Jeppu

For driving the BLDC motor an electrical commutator (inverter) is required. PWM inverter gives good performance. In two level inverter there are problems of harmonics distortions. The increase in the number of steps in voltage is one of the solutions for the above problems. This can be possible by using multilevel inverters. The conventional method produces high switching losses, results in poor drive performance. We have proposes an effective replacement for this. The effectiveness of the neutral clamped multilevel inverter based drive system is verified through simulation using MATLAB Simulink package.</p>","electric_motor_control,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control,modeling,power electronics,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/6785066-balasriram-kodi,2017-09-12 13:34:27.000000,2017-09-12 13:34:27.000000,4,19,5.0,47,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/64393/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2017, balasriram kodi

The CSTR (continuous stirred-tank reactor) carries out a hypothetical first-order exothermic reaction, where the tank temperature (T) is maintained using a cooling jacket. Liquid hold-up (h) is also being maintained by manipulating the tank outlet stream flow rate (F). Process conditions are being perturbed around the nominal operating point by random disturbances on 4 input variables, namely, Fi, Ti, Ci, and Tci.In addition, faults can be simulated for process monitoring research purposes. When no faults are simulated, one can gain process understanding of the system dynamics under normal operation. Abrupt sensor bias faults may be added in each of the 10 measured variables. Incipient faults include sensor bias ramp changes and input disturbance ramp changes. Multiplicative faults include catalyst deactivation and heat transfer fouling by exponential decay. Any combination of these faults may also be simulated together. Additive white noise is present in all output measurements. Note: Since this model is edited in MATLAB R2018a, change the Simulink preferences to run in an older version of MATLAB.References:Liu (2012), ""Fault diagnosis using contribution plots without smearing effect on non-faulty variables,"" Journal of Process Control, Vol. 22, No. 9., 1609-1623.</p>","cascade control,control design,cstr,fault detection,process monitoring,process simulation,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/8722869-karl-ezra-pilario,2018-11-08 20:17:49.000000,2018-11-08 20:17:49.000000,0,0,0.0,6,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/0f4adb84-5cda-464b-bcfd-3e1169d699e6/927c73a8-e65b-4116-99f1-eb4a21e2a801/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2017, Karl Pilario

The Simscape model of the pump can be configured to model degraded behavior due to seal leakage, blocked inlets, bearing wear, and broken motor windings. MATLAB code shows how to accelerate testing by reusing results from previous simulations.  The model can be used to generate training data for the machine learning algorithm and can be used to test the deployed algorithm.  MATLAB Live Scripts show you how to develop the algorithm. Mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical parameters are all defined in MATLAB which lets you easily resize the pump. The pump housing is imported from CAD.

The model is a 'quasi-steady' model, meaning it captures an operating point in the minimum number of simulation steps. This is equivalent to a power flow, but enables multiple operating points to be assessed in a time-domain environment. The model can be built both as a single model, or as a four-segment model that is connected through Model Reference.

There are no special libraries or additional toolboxes required.The simulink model simulates and displays N vehicles at each timestep.

The animation s-function is a modified version of the level 1 m-file s-function from the Mathworks example provided in sanim.m.Writing .jpeg animation frames to disk at each animation interval slows the simulation considerably. Set animation frames per second, anim_fps, in setup.m and re-run setup.m. Don't forget to turn off your file synchronization services to avoid syncing all the new image files.Getting started:-------------------------Get started by unzipping the .zip file, changing directories to the folder, then running setup.mat the Matlb command prompt. This will clear the workspace then populate it with the necessary variables to run the Simulink model and associated animation. It will also open the Simulink model file. Press Play or Simulation | Run to execute the Simulink model. The light blue s-function block will bring up the 2D animation figure window and display the steering vehicle at anim_fps frames per second.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Distribution file list:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------   [00_Readme.mdc.txt] - this file   [setup.m] - run this first, it will bring up the Simulink, then press play to simulate the vehicle   [createAviMovieFromAnimationSequence.m] - auxiliary m-file script for converting a sequence of .jpg images into an Avi using Matlab's VideoWriter() function.

Here, the ISI-error model is discrete-time, based on [1]. The idea was inspired by [2], where the static and dynamic feedback-DAC noise was corrected by digital error correction. In [2], thermometer encoder was used in DAC and the number of correction coefficients is 3M, where M is the number of DAC unit-elements. This demonstration shows that using dynamic element matching DAC encoder (DWA) can reduce the number of lookup-table correction coefficient from 3M to 1, which should make the ISI-error mitigation by digital error correction more viable. The correction and calibration method demonstrated here is further documented in [3]. You need Delta-Sigma toolbox to run this demonstration.References: [1] L. Risbo, R. Hezar, B. Kelleci, H.

This allows the user to simply find the relative distribution of a galaxy due to a galactic interaction.Each galaxy contains 1000 particles. The initial positions, velocities, mass, and radii can be inputted. The x, y, and z velocities are also shown. If you require only 2 galaxies, you can delete the third ""construct galaxy block"" and all its constituent inputs and traces, and it will run the same.If you require more than 3, you can copy the ""construct galaxy"" block and its inputs, and then hook the output up to the ""matrix concatenation""  block.The amount of particles initially in each body can be altered by double clicking on the ""construct galaxy"" block and inputting a ""numberOfBodies"" field. It is recommended that the user reads the README document attached.I am fairly sure this will work with releases newer than Simulink 8.9, but contact if it does not.I will modify it to make it easier to use in the future.Please contact with issues or comments.</p>","galaxy,galaxy model,galaxy simulation,simulation,simulink,simulink galaxy,simulink galaxy model,simulink galaxy simulation",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/10545627-nhan-ngo,2018-05-13 16:43:49.000000,2018-05-13 16:43:49.000000,0,0,0.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/67312/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2018, Nhan Ngo

The simulator can be used to simulate the analog response of a PIR sensor with different properties and Fresnel lens. This software tool will be an aid to the PIR sensor and Fresnel lens designers for simulating the sensor and lens response before building them for specific applications.In the Lens Property section, Fresnel lens of different specifications can be simulated by specifying the number of sectors, span, and range of each sector. If a particular sector is to be omitted, the corresponding distance can be set to zero. The sliding bars for Distance, Width and Velocity can be used to evaluate the sensor output for different scenarios. The plot titled FoV Output displays the output generated by each sector of the lens and the plot titled Final Output displays the simulated waveform at the output of the PIR amplifier circuit. The plot titled VPP vs Distance allows one to determine the model parameters using training data from an experiment.For more detail please read the paper titled ""Modeling the Analog Response of Passive Infrared Sensor"".Link: <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sna.2018.05.002"">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sna.2018.05.002</a></p>","gui,simulation,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/4804491-bodhibrata,2018-06-10 16:28:40.000000,2018-06-10 16:28:40.000000,0,0,0.0,6,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/67325/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2018, Prof. Subrat Kar, Prof. Seshan Srirangarajan, Bodhibrata Mukhopadhyay

This chapter guides the user through the process of controlling speed of a DC motor using MPC and run the controller on a real time hard-ware. To collect data for system identification, run Chapter_9_Section_6_Model.slx and then Chapter_9_Section_6_Script.m to plot the results. It is assumed that the user has Arduino Mega connected per instructions in chapter_9.Run Chapter_9_Section_7_Script.m to assess nonlinearity of the motor. In this step, the data of the DC motor is already embedded in the script. Use your collected data instead of the one in the script.Run Chapter_9_Section_8_Script.m to perform system identification. In folder Section_9, you will find the 3 linear models for the DC motor. You can use these to create MPC controller. The MPC sessions are saved under MPC_DesignTask_Chapter_9_Section_9_MPC_1.mat , MPC_DesignTask_Chapter_9_Section_9_MPC_2.mat and MPC_DesignTask_Chapter_9_Section_9_MPC_3.matThe exported MPC controllers are saved under Motor_Linear_MPC_Mode_1.mat, Motor_Linear_MPC_Mode_2.mat and Motor_Linear_MPC_Mode_3.matTo run the Multi-Mode MPC controller on Arduino, go to Chapter_9/Section_10 folder and follow these instructions:Make sure the motor hardware and the Arduino Mega board are connected to the computer with an open session of Matlab®(preferably R2017a). Set Matlab® directory to Chapter_9/Section_10 directory. In the Matlab® command window load the MPC controller .mat files by typing the commands load Motor_Linear_MPC_Mode_1.mat; load Motor_Linear_MPC_Mode_2.mat; load Mo-tor_Linear_MPC_Mode_3.mat. Open Simulink® model Chapter_9_Section_10_Model_1.slx.

Soft real timeis achieved by adding a delay to cause a match between the total elapsed simulation time andtotal elapsed wall-clock time. Because of this there is very little or no drift over manyseconds. There will always be some jitter when attempting soft-real-time on a non-real-timeoperating system like Windows, standard linux or MacOS. Useful clock resolution is around10ms on Windows machines and better in Linux or MacOS. This limits Sleep() or usleep()'sability to pause reliably at much less.The C-MEX S-function sfun_sleep.c has a user-specified sample time default of 0.01(s).This is different from the base simulation sample time of h_fixed=0.001(s).To run, double click the light blue box in upper left to initialize h_fixed=0.001(s).This block is similar to the Pace block provided in both the Aerospace Blockset and in thebase Simulink library as of Matlab R2018a. However, it provides two additionalfeatures that the Pace blocks and other user-contributed Soft Real Time blocks do not provide:(1) Full source is provided and soft-real-time is achieved through a combination of C-mexs-functions and Similink code.(2) There is no software limit on how many instances can run at a time on a single computeror within a single or multiple instances of Matlab open on a single computer.This code was developed on R2016b and is tested on Windows 10 using the MinGW 64-bit Compiler.---------------------------------------------------------------------------To install and get running:- unzip .zip file into an empty folder- open Matlab and compile the three C-mex s-functions with:    mex sfun_getSystemClockTimeval.c    mex sfun_sleep.c    mex sfun_sim_time_to_console.c- open the Simulink model and press play: soft_real_time_block.slx**-&gt; double click the light blue box in upper left to     initialize h_fixed=0.001(s).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc <a href=""mailto:Comperecomperem@gmail.comcreated"">Comperecomperem@gmail.comcreated</a> : 28 May 2018modified: 29 May 2018</p>","gettimeofday,pace,print to console,simulation pace,simulink,soft real time,system time,timeval",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2549454-marc-compere,2018-05-29 13:13:27.000000,2018-05-29 13:13:27.000000,0,0,0.0,6,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/67520/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2018, Marc Compere

The boolean result of this comparisonprovides the timer state output.A 1-pulse ping can be generated with the change detect block that looks forany difference in it's input signal.The timer is armed when a 1-pulse ping is detected which begins an elapsedtime calculation. Elapsed time is compared to the desired timer durationand the timer state is held high while t_elapsed &lt;= t_timer_duration.Inside the timer subsystem is a 'triggered capture-and-hold' block that capturesthe current simulation time when a high is detected on the ping input signal.This timer subsystem has been tested on Matlab R2016b and R2018a and a closevariant of this subsystem has been used as far back as 2004.The soft real time subsystem shown in the screenshot is not included in thissingle-file release but is freely avaialable under the MathWorks File Exchangeentry titled ""Soft Real Time Block for Pacing Simulink Simulations"" at:<a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/67520-soft-real-time-block-for-pacing-simulink-simulationsThere"">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/67520-soft-real-time-block-for-pacing-simulink-simulationsThere</a> is no requirement for the soft real time subsystem for this timer to workbut running in soft real time helps illustrate how the timer subsystem works withthe manual switch blocks.Alternatively the native Simulink 'Pace' block also helps run the system at amanageable pace for clear demonstration using the manual switch block.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc Compere, <a href=""mailto:comperem@gmail.comcreated"">comperem@gmail.comcreated</a> : 12 Jun 2018modified: 12 Jun 2018</p>","armed,captureandhold,disarmed,timer,trigger,triggeredcaptureandhold",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/2549454-marc-compere,2018-06-13 03:09:36.000000,2018-06-13 03:09:36.000000,0,1,5.0,9,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/67712/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2018, Marc Compere

In many industrial applications, the dynamics of the plants are nonlinear. The question that gets asked frequently is it highly nonlinear? Can we use linear controller technique such as PID? In this chapter, the nonlinearity will be studied before the design of the controller. The response surface across the range of operation of the plant will be generated. This surface will give insights into the number of controllers needed for the full range. Multiple MPC is then designed and the concept of switching logic is introduced along with the challenges of tuning the switching of the MPC controllers.In Chapter_6\Section_3 folder, 20 simulations for the ship are carried out by using Parallel Computing Toolbox. Read and run Chapter_6_Section_3_Script.m to carry the simulations. Methods such as changing Simulink® parameters from the script, creating new file names and checking for Matlab® licenses are included in the script. In Chapter_6\Section_4 folder, the response surface is analyzed and nonlinearity is assessed. Run Chapter_6_Section_4_Script.m to run and plot the analysis.In Chapter_6\Section_5 folder, run  Chapter_6_Section_5_1_Script.m to simulate the ship for different propeller and rudder angles. Once done, run Chapter_6_Section_5_2_Script.m to generate a set of linear models for the ship for various propeller and rudder angles.In Chapter_6\Section_6 run Chapter_6_Section_6_Script.m to generate all the MPC controllers for the various propeller and rudder angles previously generated in Chapter_6\Section_5 folder.Chapter_6\Section_7 contains the Simulink model, Chapter_5_Section_8_Model_and_Controller.slx that has the ship model alongside with the multiple MPC controllers and the switching logic. In Chapter_6\Section_8 the model of the ship and controller, Chapter_6_Section_7_Model.slx, is simulated using Chapter_6_Section_8_Script_1.m . Tracking results and controller performance are analyzed. The problem of frequent switching of MPC modes is identified. A hysteresis block is introduced to mitigate the problem. Similarly, Chapter_6_Section_8_Script_2.m is used to simulate the new switching logic, Chapter_6_Section_8_Model.slx.In In Chapter_6\Section_9 an application problem similar to the previous section is introduced. RunChapter_6_Section_9_Solution_Script.m to simulate and see tracking performance of the controller and switching logic performance.</p>","9780128139189,9780128139196,hysteresis,mpc,nonlinear,propeller,rudder,ship,switching",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/382417-nassim-khaled,2018-06-28 17:20:33.000000,2018-06-28 17:20:33.000000,0,0,0.0,9,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/67852/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2018, Nassim Khaled

2337,67888,How to Write Custom Simulink Data Type Rules in MATLAB,Alexander Carmeli,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/67888-how-to-write-custom-simulink-data-type-rules-in-matlab,"Write custom data type rules as MATLAB functions, and other automatic data type propagation policies","<p>Simulink models often begin life using purely double-precision data. As the fidelity of the model increases to include specifications of the embedded system it will be deployed on, more floating-point and fixed-point data types are often needed. Manually specifying all these data types for optimal numerical performance and system efficiency while continuing to evolve the design is time consuming and error prone.Data type automation aims to reduce this cost. You can save time, reduce effort, apply policies, and maintain correctness by adding rules to the model to ensure data types match across signals. Construct signals with the right properties so they produce errors when your rules are violated.This document explains how you can write your own data type rules as MATLAB functions and integrate them into your Simulink model’s data type propagation process.Writing your own rule is the highest level of customization and requires the most expertise and resources. There are a few simpler alternatives you should consider first. Simpler out-of-the-box methods may be more compatible with the entire MathWorks tool chain (such as verification and validation products), while highly customized methods may not be completely understood by such tools.This document describes solutions for automating data type rules in order of increasing complexity. The first section contains simple and widely capable methods. The second contains advanced techniques requiring a greater level of investment.1. Simple techniques    a. Back-propagation    b. The Data Type Duplicate block    c. The Signal Specification block2. More sophisticated and custom techniques    a. The Data Type Propagation block    b. Mask-controlled data type rules    c. MATLAB-authored custom data type rulesThe licenses required for the demonstration models in this document are Simulink and Fixed-Point Designer. The models were tested with R2018a and may work with some earlier releases as well.</p>","custom,data type rules,fixed point,function,matlab,propagation,simulink",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/1297181-alexander-carmeli,2018-07-11 19:16:58.000000,2018-07-11 19:16:58.000000,0,0,0.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/67888/versions/1/download/zip,"Copyright (c) 2018, The MathWorks, Inc.

Conventional energy storage systems consisted of banks of batteries capable of storing and delivering continuous power to the load. However the high energy density characterising the batteries making them a perfect choice for steady power supply, supplying a large burst of current from the battery degrades its lifetime.  An alternative solution is to combine batteries with high power density source capable of supplying the burst transient current such as super capacitor. In such a hybrid system, the battery fulfills the supply of continuous energy while the super capacitor provides the supply of instant power to the load. The system proposed in this model is a Stand-alone Photovoltaic Battery-Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System. An energy management technique is proposed as to control the supply and storage of energy throughout the system.</p>","battery_system_management,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/11294072-rodayna-lotfi,2018-11-16 19:00:43.000000,2018-11-16 19:00:43.000000,21,11,5.0,116,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/3ffb4ea7-1bfd-4f5b-a15b-49a6a528adcd/1adb94ac-ffc9-48a0-bfdd-00abac1712c0/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2018, Rodayna Lotfi

It is based on the work published in [1] and represents a wind turbine system with a directly-coupled (gearless) and externally excited synchronous machine. The full-converter system is composed of a six-pulse diode rectifier, a dc-dc boost converter and a two-level voltage source converter (VSC). The excitation control of the synchronous generator makes use of a buck-converter connected to the dc-link of the full-converter system.It is a hybrid model (HM), which means that it contains a combination of average and switched equivalent circuits to represent power electronic stages, and allows simulations with a time-step of 50 µs, optimizing therefore computation time.A short documentation file containing useful information on the model as well as two simulation examples focusing on Fault-Ride-Through (FRT) performance is included. Further details about  the model can be extracted from [1]. [1] - A. S. Trevisan, A. A. El-Deib, R. Gagnon, J. Mahseredjian, and M.

Similarly, three phase semi converter uses 3 SCRs T1, T3 &amp; T5 and 3 diodes D2, D4&amp; D6. R,Y,B are phase voltages with respect to ‘N’. In the circuit shown above when any device conducts, line voltage is applied across load. So, line voltage are necessary to draw Phase shift between two line voltages is 60 degree &amp; between two phase voltages it is 120 degree Each phase &amp; line voltage is sine wave with the frequency of 50 Hz. With purely resistive load current will be in phase with load voltage. Depending on value of firing angle, circuit can operate in two different modes. When α&lt;60 T1 is triggered at α=30. SCR T1 and D6 conduct and line voltage RY is applied to the load from (π/6 +α) to π/2. 60. At π/2 ‘D2’ is more positive so conducts. Therefore, line voltage RB is applied to load. This continues up to firing of T3 at (π/6 +α )Vo(avg)=(3√3Vm)/2π(1+cosα)For α≤60 the output voltage is continuous so-called continuous mode of operation.

The inverter job is to take this DC input and to give AC output, where the magnitude and frequency can be controlled. The efficiency parameters of an inverter such as switching losses and harmonic reduction are principally depended on the modulation strategies used to control the inverter. There are several techniques of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). In this design, the Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) technique has been used for controlling the inverter as it can directly control the inverter output voltage and output frequency according to the sine functions. Sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) is widely used in power electronics to digitize the power so that a sequence of voltage pulses can be generated by the on and off of the power switches. The PWM inverter has been the main choice in power electronic for decades, because of its circuit simplicity and rugged control scheme. Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation switching technique is commonly used in industrial applications, solar electric vehicle applications etc,</p>",,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/14602895-vijay,2019-08-09 04:59:40.000000,2019-08-09 04:59:40.000000,0,0,0.0,40,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/69bfe190-0c01-4e45-922b-6d60c3345dec/23f9413a-9dec-4765-85d7-60090612b4e7/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, Vijay

SVPWM for three-level inverters (whether T-Type or Neutral point clamped) is complex compared to the 2-level counterpart. The detailed development is hard to find anywhere in the available literature. In the attached two files, there given a pdf file that moves gradually along the steps required to find the ON-time control laws of the main six switches of these inverters (the other six are complementary and are automatically generated with dead-time insertion by the DSP). Also, a SIMULINK model is given to test the performance of the implemented algorithm. Application engineers who wish to use this algorithm should take care that no voltage unbalance correction mechanism is provided in this algorithm. (The error fixed in version 1.0.1 is T1B dwell time was Tb+T0/2 but it should be Ts-T0/2. Now, this error is fixed in this version!In this version, one of two possible balancing methods for the neutral point voltage is implemented without principal change in the main algorithm structure. The method uses redundant space vectors that can result in the same average poles voltages but have an opposite impact on the neutral point voltage to achieve the balancing. The modifications are easy to follow and the technical reference used is mentioned in the SVPWM block. The testing Simulink model compares the performance of the previous version with the current version.

Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is one product that can provide improved voltage sag and swell compensation with energy storage integration. Ultracapacitors (UCAP) have low-energy density and high-power density ideal characteristics for compensation of voltage sags and voltage swells, which are both events that require high power for short spans of time. The novel contribution of this paper lies in the integration of rechargeable UCAP-based energy storage into the DVR topology. With this integration, the UCAP-DVR system will have active power capability and will be able to independently compensate temporary voltage sags and swells without relying on the grid to compensate for faults on the grid like in the past. UCAP is integrated into dc-link of the DVR through a bidirectional dc–dc converter, which helps in providing a stiff dc-link voltage, and the integrated UCAP-DVR system helps in compensating temporary voltage sags and voltage swells, which last from 3 s to 1 min.</p>","an integrated dynamic voltage restorer-ultracapacitor design,dvr,dynamic voltage restorer,series compensation,sssc",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/11673880-raviteja-ganapathinedi,2019-09-15 08:58:36.000000,2019-09-15 08:58:36.000000,0,0,0.0,15,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/90892adf-b473-4ace-a03d-60a5840c3f26/fe96e8a9-1722-428a-9f6c-3b69f6c72dc3/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, raviteja ganapathinedi

The author of this contribution has previously contributed an algorithm that doesn't exploit the possibilities for suppressing the neutral point fluctuation. In the previous contribution, the suppression technique is limited to the swapping of redundant vectors. In this contribution, another suppression method is combined with the previous one. It is the manipulation of the time assigned for the zero-vector. This time is implemented by allocating it using the zero vector O111 in the middle of the pulses and O000 on both edges. The splitting of T0 between vectors O111 and O000 can be manipulated in favor of suppressing the neutral point voltage fluctuation since each vector has the same effect on the pole voltage but opposite effects on the neutral point voltage. To enable this manipulation, the SVPWM block needs to receive the NPV fluctuation signal and the three-phase currents. The derivation of pulse width control laws is given in zipped Excel files. The given SIMULINK model compare the performance of the same block with and without zero-vector manipulation. You can change the load power factor and the modulation index to see the impact on the NP voltage fluctuation</p>",,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/9338183-osama-arafa,2019-09-16 12:44:29.000000,2019-09-16 12:44:29.000000,2,1,5.0,36,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/659f6913-35cc-4592-bb95-4f6d58533c83/f14d7a1e-d031-4a0d-a106-02546e61f24e/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, Osama Arafa

The switching frequency and duty cycle decides the output voltage. In the closed loop process the output voltage is compared with a set voltage and the error value is reduced by controlling the switching pulse.

When switch is in close state then diode becomes reverse biased then input source provides the energy to inductor as well as output load. Similarly, when switch is in open state then inductor becomes discharged through diode and transfers some of its stored energy to output load. Because the switch is open and close at high frequency therefore higher order of harmonic are generate which are filtered through low pass filter.For on or off the switch at high frequency PWM (pulse width modulation) technique is used. The duty cycle of this PWM is calculated by the formula,Where D is duty cycle, Vo is output voltage and Vin is input voltage.We can see that the output voltage is directly proportional to duty cycle D means which duty ratio is increased then output voltage is also increased as well as when duty cycle is decreased then output voltage is also decreased.In this MATLAB Simulink model, an ideal switch is used for regulating the 20V dc voltages in to 10V dc. The ideal switch is on or off through pulse generator which gives the 20V amplitude switching pulse of 20KHz frequency at 50% duty ratio which is gained by the duty ratio formula. The output of this converter is not pure dc it contains the high frequency harmonic content which are removed through low pass filter. In this model 1mH inductor and 10μF capacitor has been used such as low pass filter.10-ohm resistor has been used such as an output load.

2564,73414,High Performance Single-Phase PLL with SFT phase detector,Usama Mohamed,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/73414-high-performance-single-phase-pll-with-sft-phase-detector,The Simulink model of A high-performance single-phase SFT-based PLL that gives outstanding performance is given,"<p>A high performance single-phase phase-locked loop using a sliding Fourier transform is proposed in this paper. The new PLL is using the sliding Fourier transform as a phase detector. The orthogonal signal is generated using a controlled transfer delay which is adjusted by the PLL estimated frequency. Feedback loops of the frequency and phase estimated by the PLL are used to drive the filters of the Fourier transform and to adjust the period of the transfer delay for implementing the sliding integrals.  Unlike the synchronous reference frame PLL, the proposed SFT-based PLL (SFT-PLL) is adaptive to frequency changes and provides better harmonics and DC offset rejection while maintaining a constant sampling frequency. Therefore, the proposed method lends itself to digital implementation in a simple and straightforward manner. These distinguishing features allow the SFT-PLL to be especially appropriate for interfacing weak single-phase micro-grids where high harmonic distortion and frequency variations are common characteristics. A Simulink file contains the method implementation and compares it with the second-order generalized integrator phase-locked loop (SOGI-PLL) to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method under changing grid conditions. It can be easily observed that the SFT-PLL offers superior performance in almost all testing scenarios. The implementations given here is based on a continuous-time Fourier transform where the integration of signals is used instead of accumulation. The discrete form can be easily implemented by replacing integrators with accumulators and by dividing by the number of samples instead of dividing on the periodic time for the averaging process of Fourier Transform. The discrete form is, of course, more efficient regarding the number of math operations and the use of calculations resources.The DSP implementation, however, needs special attention to deal with integrator/accumulator saturation issue. Saturation is a result of the limited capacity of numbers used by DSPs (workarounds can be advised by contacting the contributor)</p>",,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/16492342-usama-mohamed,2019-11-21 12:07:40.000000,2019-11-21 12:07:40.000000,2,0,0.0,12,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/fcfd32f6-04d1-4555-8729-6ae1834aa442/d6757e9c-313a-4bd6-8ff4-c69e35a001b1/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, Usama Mohamed

2565,73415,Three-phase SFT-PLL synchronization block,Usama Mohamed,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/73415-three-phase-sft-pll-synchronization-block,Frequency Adaptive Sliding Fourier Transform for Synchronizing VSCI to the Utility Grid,"<p>Sliding Discrete Fourier Transform (SDFT) is very efficient regarding computational load and possesses a very fast phase angle detection with excellent harmonic rejection at nominal frequency. However, at the off-nominal frequency, SDFT generates errors in both magnitude and phase angle due to spectral leakage. Also, its harmonic rejection is greatly impaired under such conditions. The attached block introduces a workaround for Fourier Transform (in sliding continuous SFT and sliding discrete SDFT flavors) to handle this disability under off-nominal frequency while avoiding variable-rate sampling. The method used to implement SFT is also combining the symmetrical component analysis technique to ensure that we get only the phase angle, magnitude and frequency of the positive sequence attributes. Sliding Fourier Transform (SFT) is used as a phase detector for a phase-locked loop whose output frequency is used to drive the SFT.   The model included compares the performance of the proposed SFT-PLL with that of the Decoupled Stationary Reference Frame PLL (dαβPLL) which is one of the widely used techniques in industrial applications. Examining the results prove that SFT-PLL is superior to dαβPLL. Hence, it can be effectively used in synchronizing VSI to weak and micro-grids particularly under sever unbalance, harmonic distortion and DC offset. The mathematics and the explanation of the block structure is given in :""Frequency-adaptive sliding Fourier transform for synchronizing VSI to the grid""International Journal of Power Electronics and Drive Systems 10(2):1034DOI: 10.11591/ijpeds.v10.i2.pp1034-1048</p>",,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/16492342-usama-mohamed,2019-11-21 12:43:10.000000,2019-11-21 12:43:10.000000,0,0,0.0,12,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/8e134bda-9ce6-4a16-a17f-ed9660d1f918/ab79ee1a-e569-4b86-bd03-527da52e5605/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, Usama Mohamed

In this project simplified method is proposed in which timing calculation is required for only one sector and therefore calculations are tremendously reduced and the same could be applied to different types of multilevel inverters like flying capacitor and cascaded. To check the validity of the scheme, simulations are done for passive(R-L) load and motor load. Open loop V/f speed control method of Induction motor is also done to enhance the validity of the scheme.</p>","facts,induction motor,inverter,power_electronics_control,space vector pulse width modulation svpwm",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3727172-indranil-saaki,2019-11-28 13:04:11.000000,2019-11-28 13:04:11.000000,0,1,5.0,36,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/2ad39161-7a4e-43b0-9fe5-be6f5fc3a0ad/46ccdff9-dd0f-45d1-b470-bb4a39f0d9d2/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, INDRANIL SAAKI

Compared to the Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost converters the Ćuk converter uses an additional inductor and capacitor to store energy. Consider the following sequence of the MOSFET conduction state:1. On-state: The current through the inductor L1 increases linearly and the diode blocks.2. Off-state: Since the current through the inductor L1 can not abruptly change the diode must carry the current so it commutates and begins conducting. Energy is transferred from the inductor L1 to the middle capacitor C2 resulting in a decreasing inductor current.3. On-state: The current through the inductor L1 again increases linearly and the diode blocks. The middle capacitor discharges and supplies the RC load through the inductor L2. The induced voltage across the resistor R has the opposite polarity of the input voltage.The circuit has two limits of operation. For a PWM duty cycle D ➝ 0 the output voltage equals zero, and for D ➝ 1 the output voltage grows toward negative infinity. In between those limits the output voltage in continuous conduction mode is given by: Vout = -D/(1-D) · Vin. The combination of inductors and capacitors acts as a second order low pass filter reducing the voltage ripple at the output.Compared to the previous DC to DC voltage converters (Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost) the Ćuk converter always allows continuous current flow through the inductors, and therefore, no discontinuous conduction mode is possible.ExperimentsChange the PWM duty cycle of the converter from 0.5 to 0.4 and 0.6 and observe how the average output voltage changes to 16 V and 36 V, respectively.Change the DC capacitor value from 10 μF to 100 μF and observe how the ripple of the output voltage is reduced.</p>","power electronics,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3158211-gaddala-jaya-raju,2019-12-04 16:18:28.000000,2019-12-04 16:18:28.000000,0,2,5.0,7,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/532e95fa-1079-4d9d-b85a-65e622b6cda7/1c658529-4e3d-4911-9c3c-f36e6c0bcaee/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, jaya raju gaddala

2587,73579,Buck-Boost Converter,GADDALA JAYA RAJU,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/73579-buck-boost-converter,A Buck-Boost converter transforms a positive DC voltage at the input to a negative DC voltage at the output.,"<p>Working principleA Buck-Boost converter transforms a positive DC voltage at the input to a negative DC voltage at the output. The circuit operation depends on the conduction state of the MOSFET:On-state: The current through the inductor increases and the diode is in blocking state.Off-state: Since the current through the inductor can not abruptly change the diode must carry the current so it commutates and begins conducting. Energy is transferred from the inductor to the capacitor resulting in a decreasing inductor current and a voltage across the resistor with the opposite polarity compared to Vin. During steady state the circuit is said to operate:  in discontinuous conduction mode if the inductor current reaches zero andin continuous conduction mode if the inductor current never reaches zero.The circuit has two limits of operation. For a PWM duty cycle D ➝ 0 the output voltage equals zero, and for D ➝ 1 the output voltage grows toward negative infinity. In between those limits the output voltage in continuous conduction mode is given by: Vout = -D/(1-D) · Vin.Note that the parallel combination of inductor and capacitor as shown above acts as a second order low pass filter reducing the voltage ripple at the output.ExperimentsChange the PWM duty cycle of the converter from 0.5 to 0.4 and 0.6 and observe how the average output voltage changes to 16 V and 36 V, respectively.Change the resistance value from 10 Ω to 80 Ω and observe how the converter goes into discontinuous conduction mode.</p>","power electronics,power_conversion_control,power_electronics_control",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/3158211-gaddala-jaya-raju,2019-12-06 00:22:52.000000,2019-12-06 00:22:52.000000,0,4,5.0,31,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/746ff1b8-c766-49e1-8cfe-9f4c718ccd78/202752b5-1274-4e9d-9373-19682403c5d0/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, jaya raju gaddala

However, this is not true in practice.The over current (OC) detection is included in the model, if all the LED produce 0 OC, this mean that the LED work properly. If the OC produce 1, this mean that the over current occurs and the LED might be broken. The solution is to increase the resistance or reduce the input voltage.In the setting, there are four thing that needs to be considered. Forward Voltage: Different LED color required different forward voltage. Normally, the red LED requires a lower voltage compared to other colors. Check the datasheet of the LED to obtain the forward voltage of each color.Maximum Forward Current:When the voltage supply is above the forward voltage, the LED can turned on, the higher the voltage, the higher the current. To ensure the LED work properly, a resistor is added to limit the current. If the current is more than the maximum forward current, the LED will be broken. This maximum forward current can be obtain from the datasheet. Sample Rate: This is the time taken for the scope to update the figure.PWM Switching Frequency:If the LED receive PWM type input, the switching frequency of the PWM needs to be inserted into the setting.</p>","fyp,led,power electronics",https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/9260469-razman-ayop,2019-12-19 04:38:10.000000,2019-12-19 04:38:10.000000,0,0,0.0,1,https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/81a0f80d-e56e-49c4-b254-5032b86cc256/515b5956-7873-4a19-8445-66bd497d96ce/packages/zip,"Copyright (c) 2019, Razman Ayop
